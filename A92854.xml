            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>'Tis a loſſe, a loſſe that cannot enough be bewailed, that ſo eminent and uſeful an inſtrument, is now by <hi>bodily weakneſſe,</hi> and <hi>prevailing indiſpoſitions,</hi> taken off from his publick Miniſterial la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: there is no murmuring againſt the hand of God, but the waſting of the <hi>old ſtock</hi> of our able Miniſters ſhould be more laid to heart; alas we that are to ſucceed in the Lords work (I am ſure I can accuſe one) with what <hi>a weak</hi> and <hi>unequal pace</hi> do we follow their <hi>great examples?</hi> and being too too early by the removal of ſuch choiſe inſtruments, put upon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervices, no wonder if we faint under the burden.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſome recompenſe for this loſſe, that this worthy ſervant of God is yet alive, not only to <hi>honour his own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> (which was moſt <hi>conſolatory)</hi> by his private diſcourſes, full of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>patient,</hi> yea, <hi>cheerful ſubmiſſion</hi> to the Will of God concerning him; but alſo to ſingle out ſuch Treatiſes of his own, as may be of moſt uſe to publick benefit and edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>And this is not enough, beſides the <hi>whip,</hi> they muſt to the <hi>Priſon, and be kept ſafe and cloſe,</hi> verſe 23. <hi>Hatred of goodneſſe doth many times precipitate evil men to the acts of injuſtice;</hi> and he who hates a good man, will many times become a bad Judge.</p>

               <p>A ſtrange Providence is that of God, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> are ſent to priſon to convert a Jayler, to unlooſe him, who bound them, to heale him, who ſcourged them, God hath ſome ſpecial ends in the times and places of his ſervants ſufferings.

               <p>But now ſee the conſequents of this, their prayers ſhooke the Heaven, and the Heaven ſhooke the Earth, ſo that the <hi>foundations of the Priſon were ſhaken, and immediately all the doores were opened, and every ones bands were looſed,</hi> ver. 26.

               <p>There are many concluſions emergent from theſe words, I will omit moſt of them, and onely inſiſt on the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Change of heart breeds change of eſtimation toward the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</hi> The Jayler a little before had a baſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and unworthy opinion of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> but now <hi>Lords, Sirs, what ſhall I do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the <hi>Heart</hi> is, ſo the <hi>Judgement</hi> is, and <hi>Newneſſe of Nature,</hi> hath with it <hi>Newneſſe of Light.</hi> We can now ſee the men and their authority, and their office, and embaſſage, and the end of all their reproofes, and inſtructions, and therefore the very <hi>feet of them who bring good tydings, and publiſh peace and ſalvation, are beautiful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It argues the heart to be baſe and ſordid, which can ſlight and ſcorne the Meſſengers of Chriſt; he hath no grace, who can contemne and vilifie a Miniſter of grace. But two things God ever works, when he confers grace, <hi>(viz.)</hi> A <hi>love of the word of Grace,</hi> and an <hi>Honouring of the Meſſengers of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Senſible ſinners are ever inqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſitive. Sirs what ſhall I do?</hi> and ſo, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>Even they were pricked in their hearts, they cry out, men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of ſinners.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſome are <hi>hardned,</hi> unſenſible, wholly overgrown with ſin, and are <hi>past feeling,</hi> Eph. 4 18. Their ſin is in them, like the waters in the Ocean; under all which, if a man doth lye, yet he feeles no weight nor burden, becauſe the Elements in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places are not ſenſibly weighty: ſo where ſin is in its center, men are unſenſible of the burden of it. They feele it not, nor their miſery, and therefore neither complaine nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, others are <hi>made ſenſible,</hi> not onely by the ordinary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115662:8"/> light of a naturall conſcience, but by the contrary principle of new and infuſed Grace: It is with them like as with a man recovering out of a deep ſickneſſe, his health comes in, and makes him now ſenſible of his weakneſs, and complaining, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring help. So when God doth by his bleſſed ſpirit work the lively ſenſe of ſinne in the heart of a perſon, the baſeneſſe of it, the danger and miſery of it. O he cannot now remaine thus, live thus, he muſt have a guide, he goes to a <hi>Meſſenger, one of a thouſand,</hi> to inſtruct and direct him.</p>
               <p>For firſt, conſcience truly awakned, cannot beare its own bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, its own diviſions, feares, accuſations, preſent condition, and therefore the perſon will enquire whether there be <hi>no balme in Gilead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, againe, ſenſibleneſſe of ſin is <hi>Opus reſpectivum,</hi> it is a work for further work. God doth for this very end make us ſenſible of our ſin and miſery, that we might enquire after the meanes of grace and ſafety.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, once more, ſcarſe one ſenſible ſinner of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that is able to be his own Counſellor, or comforter, we are not able always to apply thoſe ſweet directions, thoſe proper and heavenly comforts as God promiſes, to our own neceſſities, which yet we may diſtribute with a full and tender heart to others in their exigencies: for there is a great difference betwixt the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of comfort</hi> and the <hi>applying of comfort.</hi> He who is to propoſe it, hath a medicine to deliver; He who is to apply it, hath a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to take. There be many contrary arguments and riſings of an unbelieving and fearful nature, in the perſon who is to apply the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs of Gods promiſe</hi> to himſelf, ſo that he is not alwayes able to ſee the reach, and compaſſe of them to himſelf; and therefore no marvel if he ſeeks out for direction, in the midſt of his own confuſions, and for a help to apply, in the midſt of his own feares and diſtractions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The maine and choiſe thing which the troubled ſoule lookes</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>after, is how to ſave it ſelfe. (Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be divers ſorts of troubles, and according to their grounds and qualities, doth every perſon lay out for help and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Some are troubled with meer <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> and <hi>health</hi> is the thing which they would have. Some with poverty; and riches
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115662:8"/> are the things which they would have. Some with <hi>ignominy; and favour, and good opinion</hi> is the thing which they would have.</p>
               <p>Some with <hi>outward afflaction and puniſhment;</hi> and <hi>exemption</hi> is the thing which they would have. <hi>Remove from me this Plague onely</hi> ſaid <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some are troubled with <hi>meer terrors of conſcience;</hi> and <hi>quiet and eaſe</hi> is the thing which they would have.</p>
               <p>Others are troubled <hi>in ſoule for their ſinnes,</hi> by which God is diſhonoured, and their heart polluted; now how theſe <hi>may be ſaved;</hi> This is the thing which theſe would have.</p>
               <p>Come to a ſoul, ſenſibly groaning under the weight of ſinne, and ſay, why? Soul <hi>be of good cheer, thou haſt goods laid up for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares:</hi> Oh ſayes that ſoul, <hi>miſerable comforters</hi> are they to me, <hi>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> Come againe and ſay, you have many good and kinde friends, Alas ſaith the ſoul, friends are <hi>Phyſicians of no value</hi> to my troubled and perplexed ſoul: <hi>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> Come to that ſoul, and diſcourſe to him of the defect of ſin, of the richneſſe of divine mercy, of the Grace that God hath promiſed to give, of that ſorrow, of that repentance, of that faith, of that blood of Chriſt; O now ſayes that ſoul, ſay on, give not over, <hi>mercy</hi> is that which I would have, and <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> this is it which I would have, how I may be brought out of this miſerable and damnable condition. Suppoſe a man were very ſick, and one ſhould come and tell him many merry tales, to delude the ſenſe of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, this were nothing to a man ſick indeed; for it is not a tale, but <hi>wholſome Phyſick</hi> which would help him; he had rather by much heare the Phyſitian diſcourſing and counſelling, and applying. So it is with the truly troubled ſoul, yea that is it which he deſires and would have, <hi>to be ſet in the right way how to ſave his ſoul. Shew us the Father,</hi> ſaid <hi>Philip, and that is ſufficient,</hi> ſo here, ſhew me the way of ſalvation, and I deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e no more.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon of it is this, becauſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is nothing which ſuit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with the troubled ſoul, but the way of ſalvation:</hi> the helps and remedies of it are not to be found unleſs in theſe wayes.</p>
               <p>If a man hath a burden on his back, take it off, and that is the way to eaſe him; if a man hath a feavour, cure him of that,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115662:9"/> and this is the way to help him; if a mans bone be out of joynt, ſet it in his proper location, and this is the way to comfort him. In like manner is it here. The diſtreſſes of the ſoul are ſpiritual, and only ſpiritual waies relieve ſpiritual troubles; I now ſee God at difference with me, how may I be reconciled to him? I ſee the diſhonour againſt him, how may I pacifie him? I feel the guilt of ſin, who ſhall take that off for me? I would be a changed and new perſon, who will work this in me? what courſe muſt I take to get God to look graciouſly on me, to get theſe ſins pardoned, this heart to be ſanctified?</p>
               <p>I cannot paſſe over this point without a word of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>If ſalvation be the maine enquiry of a truly troubled ſoul, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> then verily many people have not yet been truly troubled for their ſinnes; why? Becauſe they ſtrive not how to ſave their ſoules.</p>
               <p>The Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of ſome, that <hi>God was not in their thoughts;</hi> and we may ſay of ſome, that Salvation is not in their mindes. He who hath abundance hath this queſtion, <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> and he who is in want, hath this queſtion, <hi>what ſhall I do?</hi> But, <hi>what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> few think of this, it is a marvelous thing that ſo noble a creature as man, who carries in him the ſingular ſtamp of heaven <hi>(a ſpiritual and immortal ſoul)</hi> ſhould ſo infinitely forget both himſelf and his errand into this world. <hi>I am a miſerable ſinner</hi> (ſaid Saint <hi>Hicrome) and born only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> We are born <hi>tranſgreſſors from the wombe,</hi> and with hell at our heeles; God is pleaſed to draw out the threed of our life, and to vouchſafe to give us this hint, that we are ſinners, and muſt dye, and if we change not our condition we periſh fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And beſides that, he hath addreſſed the wayes of Salvation to our hands, ſo plainely, that he who runnes may read. Yea, and there is ſomething implanted in men, which ſecretly inclines them to be affected with a generall deſire of Salvation; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, to obſerve men how variouſly they flye off, how little they minde that, which moſt of all concerns them; how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely one drudgeth for riches; how illimitedly another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues pleaſures; ſo that when we come to dye, we have hardly thought wherefore we were borne. There is a Salvation, and a way tending thereunto, but we forget that all our dayes:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115662:9"/> We have other employments, but let us ſoberly recall our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing better then Salvation? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Is there not a neceſſity to be working in the way, if ever we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> would attain unto the end.</p>
               <p>O then let this take us up; let heaven take us up; let our ſouls take us up; but let not our ſins, let not the world take us up. <hi>

               <p>The <hi>Jayler</hi> doth not ſay I deſire Salvation barely, but <hi>what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> as if he ſaid, I deſire Salvation, and I do conjecture that it is an end, and therefore means there are lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it: now whatſoever they are, point them out unto me, that I may apply my ſelf for the proſecution of the end.</p>
               <p>There are two things which deceive a mans heart.</p>
               <p>One is preſumption, which is a skipping over the leſſon, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> taking forth before we have learned our part; my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, that it is an opinion of our happineſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any uſe of meanes: As if a man went to heaven as the Ship moves in the Tyde, whether the Maſter wakes or ſleeps.</p>
               <p>Another is hypocriſie, which is an inquality of the heart to all the wayes of Salvation: No hypocrite will apply himſelf
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115662:10"/> to every thing which may indeed ſave him. But where the heart is rightly underſtanding, and truly ſenſible, there is not only a conſideration of meanes, but an illimited reſolution for all the wayes of Salvation: whatſoever courſe God doth by his Word reveale and preſcribe, for that it is reſolved and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What the <hi>Princes</hi> ſpeak with a <hi>diſembling heart,</hi> that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner rightly ſenſible of his condition, affirms with a plaine ſpirit, of true intention. <hi>The Lord be a true and faithful witneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord thy God ſhall ſend thee to us. Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we ſend thee, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He who will be ſaved muſt come to this, to deny his own will; to crucifie his own affections; to captivate his own imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to reſigne up his own deſires and pleaſures; to afflict his heart for his ſins; to give up himſelf to the rule and command of Gods Word; to draw off his heart from the world; to ſettle all his confidence upon Jeſus Chriſt; to watch over his own ſpirit; To love the Lord God with all his ſoul, and with all his might: Theſe and other things are required as the way to life, and unto them all, doth a ſinner, rightly ſenſible, yield up himſelf with all readineſs and gladneſſe.</p>
               <p>For as much as, though there may be ſome difficulty in theſe, yet there is Salvation by them; yea, and there is a ſingular help for them, as well as a ſpecial reward, but the preſent and former condition and way of ſinne is engraven with much paines, and ſore horror, and death, and hell; But I paſs on.</p>
               <p>Another concluſion from the words is this, <hi>When God doth throughly work upon mens conſciences:, perſonall injuriouſneſſes muſt be forgotten by them who are to deale with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee here that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſpeakes not a word of this cruel uſage towards them, but inſtantly addreſſe themſelves to the direction of his ſafety and comfort, <hi>Believe in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:115662:10"/>
               <p> We read of the <hi>Father of the Prodigall,</hi> that when his ſon came humbling and bewailing his fore-paſt miſcarriages of Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Luxury. <hi>He ſaw him a far off, and ran to meet him, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and put the raiment on him, and a gold Ring.</hi> He did not rate and upbraid him; Nay, I will not look on thee, I will not accept of thee, go now to thy Harlots, amongſt whom thou haſt riotouſly waſted all that goodly portion which I put into thy hands: O, no, he accuſeth not him, whom he heares to accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and reviles not him, whom he ſeeth to condemn himſelf. It is enough that his <hi>Son who was loſt, is now returned; and that he who was dead, is now alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt imitate our heavenly Father in this, who in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace,</hi> will <hi>forgive our iniquities, and remember our ſins</hi>

               <p>There are two ſorts of ſinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stout,</hi> and <hi>reſolute,</hi> who know how to ſlight mercy, neglect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> command, and to fear at the threatnings; A ſevere denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of judgment and wrath, a conviction and aggravation of their ſinnes, are the proper diſcoveries for them: For where hath God ſpoken a word of peace, or comfort, or eaſe to ſuch?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleeding and afflicted,</hi> who tremble at threatnings, gaſpe for mercy, faint for deliverance, and change. Here now <hi>Miniſters</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Troubled ſouls muſt be directed to Chriſt:</hi> for this is it which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> adviſeth the afflicted Jayler, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> They do not direct him to any man or Angel, to any pilgrimage or Saints, they ſet him not up on any ſelfe-ſtanding project, but, <hi>Beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why to Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Becauſe none is appointed to relieve a troubled ſoul but Chriſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>Him hath God the father ſealed,</hi> and he was <hi>anointed to preach glad tidings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, none is able to pacifie and quiet a troubled ſoul, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but Chriſt; whatſoever is ſinful or imperfect, cannot be a ſtay to an afflicted conſcience; But Chriſt hath <hi>perfect righteouſneſſe;</hi> he hath wrought <hi>full redemption,</hi> he is <hi>able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which cannot ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, can never pacifie an afflicted heart; but if God might be fully ſatisfied, if he might be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> reconciled, then the conſcience would be quiet; now Chriſt hath done this, he hath <hi>made peace,</hi> and become <hi>a curſe,</hi> and is a <hi>propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He will relieve the afflicted heart. He is called a <hi>merciful High</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>Priest,</hi> and one who is <hi>touched with the feeling of our infirmities,</hi> and he <hi>will not break the bruſed reed,</hi> and he <hi>calls the heavy laden to come to him to be eaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be three things which would marvelouſly eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh a troubled ſoul One, if he could get off the guilt of former <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſins. Another, if he could get ſuch a righteouſneſs, as with which he might boldly ſtand before God. A third is, if he could get his heart and wayes to be changed. Now Chriſt can yield out all this: his blood gets off the gilt of our ſins, <hi>he is made ſin for us, that we may be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him;</hi> and he can change our natures by his bleſſed Spirit. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, that he is <hi>made, redemption, righteouſneſſe, and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto us.</hi>

                     <hi>JEſus</hi> ſignifies a Saviour: as it was a name impoſed from the <note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> pleaſure of heaven, by an <hi>Angel,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. <hi>Thou ſhalt caſt his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes.</hi> The firſt name that you read of impoſed on Chriſt in the New-Teſtament, is this name of Jeſus; for the beſt name that ſinners could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſire to heare, was this, that God hath provided a Saviour for them. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9. 6. ſaith, that <hi>his name ſhall be called wonderful,</hi> and indeed Jeſus is a wonderful name: It is a name which breeds juſt wonder and admiration to all the world, to men and Angels; it may make our hearts to wonder at the <hi>hyperbole, of Gods love</hi> (as one of the Fathers ſpeaks) that he <note place="margin">Mirandum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris.</note> ſhould (notwithſtanding our vile deſerts) beſtow a Saviour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, who elſe had been loſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. That it is a <hi>name above all names,</hi> no name like it, either for the authority which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, who bare that name; or for the comfort which that name beares in it, for a ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſaid the <hi>Angel to the Shepherds, fear not, for behold, I bring you good tydings of great joy which ſhall be to all people, for unto you is borne this day in the City of David, a Saviour,</hi> Luk. 2. 11. yea, that is good news indeed. A Saviour for a ſinner: <note place="margin">What kind of Saviour Chriſt is.</note> no ſuch news as that!</p>
                  <p>Now here obſerve divers things. <hi>The Sonne of God is a ſingular Saviour.</hi> No Saviour in all the world like him. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> is called a <hi>Saviour:</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> were called ſo, yet the <hi>Son of God is a Saviour</hi> infinitely beyond them.

                  <p>He did ſtand at the Bar, not to ſuffer and ſatisfie for one ſin only, nor for all the ſinnes of one man only, nor for ſome ſinnes of moſt men only, nor for all the ſinnes of all men in former ages; but for all the ſins of all that ſhall be ſaved, from the firſt man that lived, to the laſt man that ſhall dye.

                  <p> Firſt in the <hi>aloneneſſe of it,</hi> whatſoever was required meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſave men is in him alone, there is no other name beſide his, nor with his, but he alone is a Saviour, there is <hi>one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jeſus,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. There is no concurrence of any Angel, nor of the Prayers of any Saints departed, and glorified, nor yet in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent ſanctity in any man living nor yet of any workes before, or after grace, which comes in with Chriſt as a meritorious cauſe of our Salvation: But Jeſus Chriſt alone, is ſufficient, and effectual to ſave the ſinner: as the <hi>government is upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> ſo is our Salvation.

                     <hi>the Meſſiah which is by interpretation the Chriſt,</hi> and this is a ſweet word unto us, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he, who was our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> was <hi>anointed. The Lord hath anointed me to preach good ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> Iſaiah 61. 1. <hi>And he was anointed with the Oyl of gladneſs,</hi> Pſal. 45. 7. will you give me leave to let you ſee much excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in this ſhort word? We do ſpeak much of Jeſus, and yet we are ignorant of the forme of his ſaving; and we heare much of Chriſt, but perhaps we underſtand not what force, what comfort, what happineſſe is couched therein; therefore I will unfold unto you, 1. What this anointing of our Saviour doth import. 2. Unto what he was anointed.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, the anointing of him in whom we are to believe, doth ſignifie.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>ſingular and aſſured ordination</hi> to be our Mediator, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> performe the work of our redemption. When that the <hi>Prophet had poured the Oyl on the head of Jehu,</hi> they preſently <hi>blew the trumpet, and ſaid, Jehu is King:</hi> ſo when <hi>Zadock</hi> the Prieſt tooke a horne of Oyl out of the Tabernacle, and <hi>anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Solomon, they blew the trumpet, and all the people ſaid, God ſave King Solomon</hi> 1 Kin. 1. 39. (as if he ſaid) this is the very perſon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath appointed to rule over us. In like manner, becauſe the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115662:14"/> Son of God is made a Chriſt, becauſe he is anointed, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly conclude, that that perſon, who was God and man, was appointed, and ſingularly deſigned to be our Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; ſo that we may with <hi>Iohn,</hi> point at him, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi> And therefore it is ſaid that he was called, that he was ſealed, that he was ſent; it was the Act of the whole Trinity, to ſet the ſon apart, to become our Saviour: So now for Chriſt to be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, is no fiction, but a reall thing; nor was it undertaken preſumptuouſly, without a calling, but by ordination and the inſtitution of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An abundant qualification</hi> (that is,) that perſon, <hi>the Son of</hi>

                     <hi>God,</hi> being anointed or deſigned to be our Redeemer, was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with all the richneſſe of Grace, and fitneſſe of gifts, every way required to performe the work of our redemption; <hi>I have laid help</hi> (ſaid the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19.) <hi>on one that is Mighty;</hi> ſo is it here, our Salvation is to be wrought by one who is enabled to compaſs and performe it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we read of the <hi>pouring forth of the ſpirit on him,</hi> and <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 34. Pſa. 45. 7.

There was no want of holineſſe which the Law could require, either for nature or actions, and no word of power to ſuffer or conquer. Yea, he was ſo adorned and beautified with abilities to ſave, that he did not only at once go through the hard task of our Redemption, but he ſtill diſtills ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue down by his Spirit, to ſave us more and more from our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>anointed?</hi> For a ſatisfaction to this demand, we muſt know that thoſe who were anointed, by Gods command, were <hi>ſequeſtred to ſingular and ſpecial offices thereby,</hi> and there were three ſorts of perſons, who were to execute three ſorts of offices, who were anointed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as we read of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the reſt of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Prophet,</hi> as <hi>Eliſha</hi> by <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 Kings 19. 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> by <hi>Zadock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> differs from all others, who were anointed, we read that ſome were anointed to be <hi>Kings,</hi> but not to be <hi>Prieſts</hi> nor <hi>Prophets;</hi> others were anointed to be <hi>Prieſts;</hi> but neither to be <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor <hi>Kings:</hi> others were anointed to be <hi>Prophets,</hi> but neither to be <hi>Kings,</hi> nor <hi>Prieſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe we read of ſome who were to be <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> others to be <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> ſome to be <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> but not any one was anointed a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt</hi> and a <hi>Prophet</hi> conjunctively.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115662:15"/> to all thoſe three offices, not only to be a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but alſo a <hi>Prophet,</hi> not onely to be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> but alſo to be a <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had he been a <hi>Prieſt</hi> only, he might have offered ſacrifice, for our ſinful gilt. But who ſhould have then been the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> to have <hi>opened the eyes of the blind,</hi> and to give the ignorant knowledge?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Nay that he might be a compleat Saviour and Mediator. He was <hi>anointed to be Prieſt Prophet and King.</hi> I will open ſomething in every one of theſe.</p>
                  <p>He was anointed, to be a <hi>Prieſt. Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedek,</hi> Pſal. 110. 4. ſo Heb. 3. 1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is called the Apoſtle and <hi>High Prieſt of our profeſſion</hi> ver. 2. He was faithful to him that appointed him, ſee <hi>Heb</hi> 4. 10. 7. 26. There are theſe things implyed in his anointing to be our <hi>Prieſt..</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That he was <hi>deſigned perfectly to fulfil the Law of God for us.</hi> He was a ſatisfactory Prieſt, there was the ceremonial Law which he fulfilled by abrogation, and there was the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> which he fulfilled by obedience. Whatſoever the Law of God could require, either for the holineſſe of nature, or of life, that was to be found in Chriſt: And <hi>ſuch a high Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmeleſſe, undefiled, ſeperate from ſinners, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 7. 26. Hence is he often called the <hi>holy and juſt one,</hi> Act. 3. 14. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 27, 30. and is ſaid to be without ſin. He had no ſinne at all of which he was perſonally gilty, but he was every way a righteous perſon and <hi>fulfilled all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay fulfilled it, not for himſelf only, but for us; ſo that if you would now look for a righteouſneſſe which can every way ſatisfie, and which is every way punctually exact, and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, you muſt look out of your ſelves, unto the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. and therefore he ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs unto every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10. 4.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>make expiation for ſinnes:</hi> He was an expiatory Prieſt.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115662:16"/> There was in the Law, ſacrifices offered by the Prieſt, of which ſome were <hi>Gratulatory,</hi> wherin God was praiſed; and others were <hi>Expiatory,</hi> wherein God was appeaſed; as in the oblations of the Lamb, &amp;c. thus it ſtands with us. As we are creatures, we are bound to obey God; as <hi>rational and righteous creatures,</hi> we were bound to <hi>obey the Morall Law</hi> of God, and now as <hi>ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> we are bound to <hi>anſwer the tranſgreſſions of that Law,</hi> by expoſing our perſons to the endurance of the great curſe of that Law, and the wrath of God: The Law is broken by us, Gods juſtice is wronged, his indignation moved, and our own gilt, like ſo many cords hold us faſt, and deliver us bound hand and foot to the vengeance and puniſhment of Gods pure and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuppoſe you ſaw a number of Malefactors going to execution, the Kings Son meets them, they are heavy, weeping and ſobbing becauſe death is approaching; Why? ſaith the Kings Son weep not, you have provoked my father, and have deſerved death, but fear you not, I will take a courſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your lives: How ſo? Thus, I will lay down my own life for you, I will dye for you, to deliver you. It is even thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and us, we all have ſinned, and by reaſon of ſinne are bound over to death, and hell, how now ſhall we eſcape? Thus, God did give his own Son, and he did take our ſins on him, and did dye and ſhed his blood to expiate our gilt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our pardon. Hence is he called a <hi>ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> and he is <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 1 Pet. 2. Eſay 53. Rom. 4.</note> ſaid to <hi>be made ſin for us.</hi> And <hi>to beare our ſins in his own body on the tree,</hi> and that <hi>our iniquities was laid on him.</hi> and that the <hi>chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him,</hi> and to be <hi>delivered to death for our ſinnes</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt our Paſſeover was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for us,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 7.

                  <p> Firſt, the Prieſt, who did offer this expiatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſacrifice it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Altar upon which it was offered.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The dignity and efficacy thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſt, was Jeſus Chriſt, as God and man, as our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for that did belong to the Prieſt, who was to offer ſacrifice, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to be a middle perſon: <hi>Aaron</hi> was to bear upon him the ſinnes of the people, and to offer for them; ſo Jeſus Chriſt, as God and man, was he who did offer up that ſacrifice, which did expiate our ſinnes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 5. He that ſaid unto him, <hi>thou art my Sonne, to day have I begotten thee,</hi> verſ. 6. He ſaith alſo in another place, <hi>Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſacrifice it ſelf, was Chriſt as conſiſting of ſoul and body: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by reaſon of our ſins we had forfeited both our ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes to the curſe of the Law, and to the wrath of God: The arreſt and attachment was out againſt both, but now Jeſus Chriſt became our Prieſt and offered his ſoul and body, to quit and releaſe ours. Therefore it is ſaid, that he <hi>made his ſoul an offering for ſint,</hi> Iſai. 53. 10. And that <hi>his ſoul was exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, even to death,</hi> Mat. 26. 38. In it he felt the bitter anguiſh and wrath, which made him to <hi>ſweat, even drops of blood;</hi> And, as for his body, that was prepared for him to ſuffer for us; hence it is ſaid, that he <hi>bore our ſins on his own body on the tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. It is very true, that the Godhead formally, was not the ſacrifice, that could neither ſuffer, nor be afflicted, only it did aid and aſſiſt the humane nature, which was offered up as a ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>The Altar on which this ſacrifice was offered, which did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> our ſins, was Chriſt as God; as the ſuffering did properly belong to the humane nature, ſo the efficacy of that ſuffering, did appertaine to the divine nature; had he been God only, he could not have ſuffered, had he been man only, he could not have merited: <hi>The Altar ſanctifieth the gift,</hi> not the gift the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; for here that which did make up the high efficacy of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, was the divine nature of Chriſt. That Jeſus Chriſt who was God and man did offer up himſelf as a ſacrifice for ſinnes, was more then if all the holy Angels and holy men in the world
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115662:17"/> had ſuffered; there is now, by reaſon of the divine nature an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite dignity to anſwer for all our ſins which elſe had ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancelled.</p>
                  <p>The efficacy of this ſacrifice, which is this, that he took away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> our ſins, blotted out the hand writing, nailed them to his croſs, buried them in his grave.</p>
                  <p>Heb. 9. 28. <hi>Chriſt was</hi> once offered to bear the ſins of many, 10, 11. <hi>Every High Prieſt</hi> ſtandeth daily miniſtring and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often-times the ſame ſacrifice which can never take away ſins. 12. <hi>But this man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins, for ever ſate down on the right hand of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He did by his ſacrifice take away all the gilt of ſin, and all the ſatisfactory puniſhment, for all this was charged upon him as our <hi>Mediator,</hi> our Prieſt, and our ſurety, yea and he made a perfect reconciliation betwixt his father and us, and therefore as our Prieſt he is our propitiation, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. and our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliator and peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14. and our atonement, Romanes 5. 11.</p>
                  <p>So that to give the ſumme of all this, <hi>Jeſus Christ was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> that is, <hi>deſigned by God the Father to be our Prieſt, (i. e.)</hi> to offer up himſelf, as a perfect ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice, for the remiſſion of all our ſins, and puniſhments, and this he did perfectly performe for us, and this was accepted of God for us.</p>
                  <p>I ſay for us, he was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him; and who is made righteouſnes, redemption, and ſanctification, and wiſdome to us, and that of God, whatſoever he did, or ſuffered from his Father, it was as our ſurety, in our ſtead, and ſo it is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>A third part of his Prieſtly office is this, that he doth make interceſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. <hi>He bare the ſinnes of many, and made</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors,</hi> ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. <hi>It is Chriſt that dyed, or rather that is riſen againe, and is even at the right hand of God who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> And therefore he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our <hi>advocate,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. and is ſaid to appear for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. He is as it were the Deputy, or rather our Attorney, to Negotiate for us, with the Father.</p>
                  <p>There is a two fold interceſſion, one by way of duty, another
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115662:17"/> by way of merit, one of charity, another of dignity, When I pray for any man in diſtreſſe, I am ſaid to be an interceſſor, to deal for him with God, as a matter of my duty, and out of a charitable reſpect; But Chriſt he only interceeds <hi>meritoriouſly,</hi> and by way of <hi>dignity.</hi> His interceſſion, as I conceive, intimates three things.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>exhibition of his perſon before the Father,</hi> as our Surety, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our Redeemer, our Mediator, I am he, and I am here to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>exhibition of his glorious merits:</hi> for he doth not nakedly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> appeare, who appeares as an interceſſor, but he muſt actively appeare, and ſo doth Chriſt. He <hi>went up to heaven</hi> with the <hi>price of his blood,</hi> with the <hi>ranſome which he purchaſed,</hi> with the <hi>righteouſneſſe, and ſatisfaction</hi> made with the <hi>merits of his oblation and ſacrifice,</hi> and there he preſents them continually before his father, as if Chriſt ſhould ſtill ſay, <hi>Father I am he that dyed for to get pardon, to get favour, to get grace, and to get ſuch or ſuch good things,</hi> this is the <hi>blood that I ſhed, the price that I paid, to ſatisfie thy juſtice, to fulfil thy Law, to remit theſe ſins, to confer theſe graces, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ingratiating us with the Father:</hi> which he doth by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> continuall <hi>application of his own merits;</hi> when ſin gets up to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our perſons, and our prayers, then Chriſt ſhews himſelf our interceſſor by putting aſide the force of the bill of complaint, and anſwers for our perſons, and for our ſervices.</p>
                  <p>True O Father! this man hath ſinned thus againſt thee, but I am his ſurety, to ſatisfie for theſe his ſinnes, and I did ſhed my blood for them, therefore now look not on him, but on me, and for my ſake, accept of him and be propitious to him.</p>
                  <p>So for infirmities, true O Father! his imperfections in duty are many, but I am to <hi>beare the iniquity of the holy offerings: and my righteouſneſſe is perfect,</hi> and that I preſent unto thee for him; now notwithſtanding his weakneſſes, for my merits, accept of his perſon, grant him his requeſt, do him good. Thus Chriſt is the Angel, <hi>who offered up the prayers of the Saints with incenſe,</hi> Rev. 8. 3, 4. Nay, Father accept and incline thine eares, I have deſerved acceptance, and audience, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>There is no perſon, who muſt dare to preſcribe any other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but ſuch as Chriſt hath delivered.

                  <p>That he is to make us know effectually the things which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doth reveale in his Word. There is no Prophet able to convey his doctrine beyond the eare, though it be as true, as truth it ſelf; and as good, as goodneſſe it ſelf; we cannot make men to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, nor to believe it, nor to yield unto it; but Chriſt is that Prophet, whoſe Chair is in heaven, and whoſe ſpeaking can yet pierce into the hearts of men: He can make us to know wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he can teach our reines, and truth in the inward parts, there can he write his Law in our hearts; though the minde be

                  <p>LAſtly, <hi>Chriſt was anointed to be a King;</hi> therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 2. he is called <hi>Gods anointed;</hi> and ver. 6. the <hi>King</hi> whom he <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 2.</note> did <hi>ſet upon his holy hill of Sion.

He ſhall <hi>reigne over the houſe of Jacob,</hi> Luk. 1. 33. ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</hi> He hath the <hi>Scepter</hi> of <hi>Royalty,</hi> and the <hi>Rod</hi> of authority, and the ſword of power, and the throne of judgement, and the Laws of his lips, and the keys of life and death.</p>
                  <p>Now this regal office of his, to which he was anointed, imports many things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that he is to beare rule over all the Nations; and indeed his natural kingdome reacheth over all the world, from the higheſt Angel to the loweſt Devil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he is to <hi>Governe and rule the Church, which he hath purchaſed with his blood; The Government is upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> Iſai. 9. 6. And therefore he is called the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> Jam. 4. 12. and <hi>all judgment is committed to his hand,</hi> Joh. 5. 22, 27. to this end you have the <hi>rod of his Scepter his holy and righteous Laws,</hi> and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115662:19"/> his mighty and bleſſed Spirit, to give force unto them, even into our hearts, and there to <hi>bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he is to <hi>maintaine and uphold his Church,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid <hi>to Gird his ſword upon his th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gh,</hi> Pſal 45. 3. and to <hi>ride upon a horſe with his garment dipped in blood and armed,</hi> as if he were ready to fight. He is the mighty redeemer of his ſervants, againſt all who intrench upon their peace and ſafety; and he ſtrikes downe <hi>Paul</hi> to the earth for perſecuting him.</p>
                  <p>It belongs to the King to be the defence of his ſubjects, ſo here, God hath appointed all the Protections, and ſafeties, and deliverances of the Church to be in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he is to conquer all his and our enemies; God hath given Chriſt a Kingdome, but it is ſuch as he muſt fight for; Not a Subject which he hath, which comes in unto him, but by conqueſt; If we be in our own hands, <hi>peccatum Hoſtiseſt, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu eſt,</hi> ſaid Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and if we be in Satans hands, we are in that enemies hands.</p>
                  <p>More plainely, there are theſe enemies of Chriſt and his Church which he is to conquer for himſelfe and them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt hell, and we read that he hath <hi>ſpoiled principalities and powers, and made a ſhew of them openly, and triumphed over them,</hi> Col. 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54. <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> 55. <hi>O death where is thy ſting, O grave where is thy victory, &amp;c.</hi> 56, 57. <hi>But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly ſin, and this is, Chriſt alſo to conquer; he is to <hi>caſt down all the ſtrong holds of luſts, and all imaginations, and to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the whole man;</hi> He is to ſubdue our iniquities for us, and not to ſuffer ſin to have dominion over us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Wicked men,</hi> he will ſtick his arrowes in the breſts of Princes, and in the hearts of the mighty, and terrible; he is to <hi>bruiſe the Nations with a rod of Iron,</hi> and to <hi>daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſell:</hi> He will execute judgment upon all of them, and caſt them all to the duſt, who roſe up againſt his perſon, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or people. He will ſet his people at reſt from them that riſe againſt them, and will <hi>make his enemies his foot-ſtool.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is like a ring, and faith is like the finger, which wears it. He is like a treaſury, and faith like the hand, which draws out thence. As <hi>David</hi> ſpake in another kinde, <hi>come and I will tell you, what the Lord hath done for my ſoul!</hi> or as <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nael, can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip</hi> ſaith, <hi>come and ſee.</hi> The ſame is to be ſaid of faith, God hath done great matters for ſinful man ſaith faith, Why? but can any good be brought by any to us who are ſo bad? yes, ſayes faith, come and ſee, Chriſt is very good, he is a Saviour for a poor ſinner, but it is faith which finds him ſo.</p>
               <p>Marke the anſwer of the Apoſtles here in the text, <hi>what ſhall I do to be ſaved,</hi> ſaith the Jayler?</p>
               <p>They do not anſwer, there is a Jeſus Chriſt, take thou no more care; he did dye for ſinners, and thou ſhalt do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: Nay, this they anſwer, thou maieſt be ſaved by Chriſt, but thou muſt believe in Chriſt. Not a medicine is the remedy, but a medicine applyed. Not the man, but the man taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the husband; So the taking of Chriſt, the believing in him is the way to heaven.</p>
               <p>Becauſe this is an excellent point (for our life lies in it) give me leave to ſpeak ſomewhat of faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the general and there I will be brief.</p>
               <p>Secondly in ſpecial, as juſtifying of faith, or faith believing in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:115662:20"/>
               <p> Firſt, Generally.</p>
               <p>For the generall nature of believing, obſerve theſe propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>that believing is an aſſent to ſuch matters as are known, only by revelation from another;</hi> there are in the ſoul of man three qualities by which we came to finde out or perceive things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, one quality is <hi>Scientia, or knowledge,</hi> which is a firme aſſent unto a thing which may be evidenced to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſolid demonſtration of infallible principles, or elſe by the undeniable evidence of ſenſe, and experience: as thus, that every natural body hath power to move, or that the Moon will ſuffer an Eclipſe or that the fire is naturally apt to aſcend, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to moiſten, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe things have both a naturall certainty and truth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and there is an undoubted evidence and certainty in the minde of the perſon, truly knowing them; and ſo certaine and full is the perſwaſion of the minde, about them, that there is no ſcruple of doubt remaining to diſcuſs, as any uncertainty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things be ſo or no.</p>
               <p>Another is opinion, which is an inevident evident aſſent, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I may ſo phraſe it: My meaning is, the underſtanding doth ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and yield to the things, as that yet it ſees ſome contrary reaſon to ſuſpect and queſtion whether the thing be ſo or no; for as much as (in opinion) the grounds are not fully evident to the minde, but they are only probable, and therefore the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by opinion, is but <hi>conjectural.</hi> As take a man in a caſe of a ſcrupulous conſcience, there is to that man ſome evidence of argument which doth ſeem to warrant his action or attempt, and yet that argument is not ſo entirely convincing of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but on the other ſide, there ſtarts up a medium or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which renders the practice probably ſinful; whereupon, if you come to demand of him; May you do ſuch a thing? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers I do not certainly know (that is) I am not entirely and abſolutely reſolved of it, yet I think I may, I think it is lawful; and this thinking (which is opinion) is alwayes accompanied with ſome fear and ſuſpition; ſo that the minde is like a paire of Scales tottering and tilting to either ſide. Things are partly cleare, and partly obſcure, partly, evident, and partly inevident,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115662:20"/> and therefore the aſſent of opinion is alwayes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>Another is beliefe, which is an aſſent unto things not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> evidence of the things themſelves, but only from the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or teſtimony of another.</p>
               <p>If I feel the fire to burne my hand, I do not call this a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a ſenſitive knowing, if <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> comes and tells <hi>David,</hi> that his <hi>Son Abſolom is hanged and ſlaine,</hi> though this be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in him who ſaw it, yet it is belief in <hi>David,</hi> who did heare and credit the tidings; ſo that (to be brief) belief differs from knowledge in this, that knowledge depends on the evidence of things themſelves; but belief, though the things be certainly true to which it doth aſſent, yet it aſſents unto them for the <hi>teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or authority of him who relates and reports them.</hi> Though this be moſt true, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was borne of the Virgin Mary,</hi> and that he is the <hi>Meſſias and Saviour,</hi> yet I beleeve it to be true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>God hath given teſtimony or report thereof in his Word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Belief</hi> differs from opinion in this, that opinion is an <hi>indifferent, probable, hazarding, and difficultly inclinable aſſent, but in believing the aſſent is firme, certaine and fixed</hi> eſpecially where teſtimony and authority is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Believing as it is reſtrained to a theological and divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that is (in the generall) an <hi>aſſent of the ſoul to the truth, and goodneſſe, of all divine revelations upon divine teſtimony.</hi> Here much might be ſaid, as for inſtance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that all divine revelations are the object of belief, as <hi>ſupernaturally inſpired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that the ground of believing them is Gods own teſtimony. Faith hath ſufficient reaſon to believe all things there to be true in their relation; becauſe of his truth and authority who doth ſay ſo <hi>(viz.)</hi> God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, of the generall nature of believing, which is an aſſent unto all ſpoken by God as moſt true and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Secondly, particularly, of juſtifying Faith.</p>
               <p>Faith (as you well know) hath a double aſpect, one is to the whole revealed Word of God, another is to God in Chriſt or to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:115662:21"/>
               <p> I am not now to ſpeak of it, as an eye which may ſee all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, but as an eye fixing it ſelf on ſome ſingular and ſpecial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>(viz.)</hi> on Jeſus Chriſt, in reſpect of whom it is called juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith: The believing on whom may be thus deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>

                  <p> That the will or heart of man ſhould be brought off from it ſelf, and to abhor its own condition and ſufficiency, and to take Chriſt as God propounds him, to be the only rock upon which I muſt built my ſalvation, to be the only Lord to whoſe Law and Will I muſt reſigne up my whole ſoul, and to cleave unto him in a <hi>conjugall union and affection;</hi> This I ſay ariſeth, not from naturall principles, nor from the wiſdome of a mans free will, nor from any endeavour or action which can find footing in man himſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerved that there are two ſorts of habits. <note place="margin">Two ſorts of Habits.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some which are <hi>acquired</hi> by the induſtry of the perſon, and through a right uſe of a ſegacious and underſtanding mind, and ſuch may be purchaſed by practiſe, and uſe; as the Scholar by writing, gets the habit of writing, and the Apprentiſe by his wiſe and honeſt obſervation, and induſtry, gets into the skill of his trade and calling; Now faith is no ſuch quality, we can ſend forth no ſuch ſingular acts or operations, which are able in time to ripen or beget ſo excellent a Grace in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others are plainly and entirely infuſed. Faith is not water in the Earth, which a man may pump out, but it is even in the fulneſſe or littleneſſe of it, in the allneſſe of it, as the drops or ſhowers of raine, which come from heaven: Though the ſubject of it be below, yet the cauſe of it is above, it is man who doth believe, but it is Gods Spirit alone who gives him that faith to believe; it is the will of man which doth take and receive Chriſt; but it is Gods Spirit who doth beſtow that grace of faith, by which he doth take and receive.</p>
                  <p>That a man hath a will, none can deny, who know that they are men; Nay, and that the will is able to ſend out its own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is willingly confeſſed; but infinite is the difference 'twixt the naturall actions of the will, and the ſupernatural qualities and operation of Gods Spirit in the will: It is true, a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe is able of it ſelf to ſend forth a ſtinking ſmell, but it is not able to quicken and enliven it ſelf. That the will can, will I grant, but that the will can (of it ſelf) enliven it ſelf, to that great part of life, I meane believing, it is not only a vehement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and diſhonour to the fountaine and freeneſſe of grace, but alſo a moſt fooliſh, and ſenſeleſſe error; the will of man being
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115662:22"/> naturally ſo oppoſite to believing, and believing being an act ſo every way unſutable, and diſproportionable to the inclination and ability of the will. No verily, faith in God comes from God, and ſo faith in Chriſt, from Chriſt; none ever could ſee Chriſt in a juſtifying and ſaving way, who had not that eye of faith put into him by the Spirit of Chriſt.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some generally corrupted both in their natures, and in their lives, and they are as unſenſible as they ere ſinfull. They do not know in any powerfull degree of true reflection and feeling, their own vileneſſe, accurſedneſſe and miſerableneſſe of perſons being ſo, and remaining ſo in an unſenſible condition of ſinfulneſſe, I dare confidently affirme, that though they may have moſt able and ſtrong preſumptiors, yet they have not (as yet) the leaſt degree of juſtifying and ſaving faith. How can any man by <hi>Faith look upon Jeſus Chriſt as his Phyſitian, who is whole in his own opinion. The unſenſible ſinner,</hi> as he cannot cloſe with Chriſt, ſo he will not care for Chriſt; for what ſhould now move ſuch an heart, is it this holineſſe of Chriſts perſon! Good Lord! How ridiculous is that motive to a profane and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe heart, or is it the ſutableneſſe of Chriſts Office; Why? what is Salvation to him by another, who as yet ſees no ground or reaſon of condemnation in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others ſenſibly experienced, who know thus much, that they in particular are ſinful, and there is no Salvation, no hope of it from themſelves, but it is to be found onely in Jeſus Chriſt.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115662:22"/> I confeſſe there are ſeverall degrees of this ſenſibleneſſe; neither dare I to aſſigne the height and latitude of it unto the tearmes of horror and terror, (that is) that a perſon muſt be alwayes and neceſſarily anguiſhed with extremities of amazement and dejections, before he can believe in Chriſt: No, though theſe ſharp throwes are manifeſt in ſome, yet I dare not make them a rule for all: only this I ſay, that the heart believes not, it looks not towards Chriſt, till it <hi>feel it ſelf to be ſinful, and loſt by reaſon of ſin;</hi> and that there is no poſſibility of ſubſiſtence in it ſelf: And now there is room for <hi>faith</hi> when I feel my ſelf a ſinner; now there is reaſon for me to look upon a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and when I am <hi>ſenſible</hi> of my <hi>own vileneſſe;</hi> now is there reaſon to look upon another <hi>righteouſneſſe;</hi> and when I perceive my own <hi>loſtneſs,</hi> now is there cauſe to look after <hi>that ſalvation which God hath put in the Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Me thinks that of Chriſt, <hi>he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners, that he is ſent to finde that which is lost, that the whole need not a Phyſitian, but the ſick;</hi> that he is ſent to <hi>preach liberty to the captives,</hi> do abundantly confirme this truth: Yea, and our own experiences gives in a clear evidence, that not only in the beginning, but in the progreſſe of our converſion, our eyes are then moſt upon Chriſt, to look after him, and to prize him when we are moſt ſenſibly acquainted with our own ſinfulneſſe, and miſerableneſſe of condition.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There be who diſtinguiſh 'twixt three kindes of faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Credere deum,</hi> which is a univerſall and large conception of a God, when the underſtanding is perſwaded, (beyond A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115662:23"/> 
                     <hi>to believe that there is a God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Credere Deo,</hi> and this is ſuch a diſpoſition of the underſtanding, by which it gives credit or belief to that God, ſpeaking and revealing, as to one who is truth, and cannot lye.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Credere in Deum,</hi> which is not only a credence to God, as true in his Nature and Word; but a reliance on him with the will, and embracing of him and his truth and goodneſs with the affections.</p>
                  <p>Now juſtifying faith, or faith in Chriſt, is comprehended in this latter kinde of believing. For the better apprehending of this, obſerve a few things <hi>(viz.)</hi> Firſt, the things which God doth propound unto us are of different ends and uſes, ſome are propounded meerly to be known, of which ſort ſome conjecture many <hi>hiſtoricall paſages</hi> in the Word, and many <hi>predictions,</hi> and many <hi>Genealogies;</hi> Some are propounded, <hi>not only to be known, but alſo to be done, as the Divine Precepts, or Commandments;</hi> ſome are propounded to be <hi>known, and to be avoided, or declined,</hi> as all the <hi>comminations</hi> and <hi>threatnings</hi> in the Word againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Some are propounded <hi>to be known, and to be embraced with the will and affections,</hi> of which ſort are all the <hi>Promiſes of God,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> All thoſe parts of the Word which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine our good, and our good to be embraced. They have a neceſſary and naturall reference to the will of man, which is planted in us by God, to be converſant about all that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects our good. Since then Jeſus Chriſt is our good, both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally conſidered, and alſo vertually conſidered; faith therefore as converſant about him, muſt naturally be planted in the will.</p>
                  <p>That there are two parts (as it were) of faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> One is imperfect, and in compleat, yet is it a neceſſary ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> unto faith, and this reſpects the underſtanding, when we are ſupernaturally illightned, to ſee the Goſpel and Jeſus Chriſt in it revealed to be a Saviour; yea, and we do aſſent or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame Goſpel to be a word of truth, and that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it doth affirme of Jeſus Chriſt, it is infallibly true, and divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certaine. The Goſpel as the Word of truth, is the object of this, and therefore the underſtanding is to apprehend and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:115662:23"/>
                  <p> Another is <hi>perfect,</hi> (I ſpeak of an eſſential perfection, not of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that which is gradual, and intenſive,) which takes in the formall and vital nature of faith, as juſtifying: Now this doth not reſt in any operation of the minde, or underſtanding, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in the will, for the Goſpel conteines both truth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; It is the Word of truth, and the Goſpel of Salvation. It doth not only make known a Saviour, and that it is moſt certain that he is God and man, and dyed for ſinners, but it doth offer the goodneſſe of this Saviour unto me, which to accept, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines directly and immediately to the will: That of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle me thinks, gives ſome light to the matter in hand, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, is a truth not to be queſtioned, and therefore the underſtanding is to acknowledge the ſame: And that he came to ſave ſinners, is not only a truth revealed, but a goodneſſe offered, and therefore it is worthy of all acceptation; Now as <hi>credence</hi> of the truth of it appertaines to the underſtanding, ſo the acceptance of the goodneſſe of it doth appertaine to the will: Yea, one word more: it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work of faith, to conjoyne the ſoul with Chriſt, to contract and eſpouſe it, (as it were) but the ſoul is not conjoyned with Chriſt by the meer opperation of the underſtanding, but by the conſent of the will; <hi>Ergo,</hi> faith as juſtifying, is immediately and formally in the will, and not nakedly in the underſtanding.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>proper and genuine act of faith,</hi> as juſtifying, or as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> about Jeſus Chriſt, is <hi>acceptance, or receiving.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Actus.</note> This Doctrine Chriſt himſelf doth teach, and therefore it is true, and ſure, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>To as many as received him, he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to as many as believed in his Name.</hi> There you ſee expreſly that believing is the receiving of Chriſt. As if God came in theſe tearmes, I have appointed my Son to be made man, to be a Mediator and Redeemer, and he did live and dye for ſinners, to procure their peace and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115662:24"/> Now I offer his perſon unto you, and with it all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and benefits purchaſed by him, take him in his perſon, in his offices, and in all his vertues, if the heart doth now accept of the Lord Jeſus. This is a lively, and juſtifying, and ſaving belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p>There are three acts of the ſoul which are converſant about Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, one is, I know aſſuredly, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt the Lord is the Saviour of ſinners.</hi> The Papiſts generally make this the <note place="margin">Credence.</note> Royall Act of Faith, but this cannot be juſtifying faith, becauſe Firſt, this as ſo, is but a truth apprehended, and not a good received. Secondly, unbelieving hearts may enjoy this hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call aſſent meerly as aſſent.</p>
                  <p>Another is, <hi>I take this Jeſus Chriſt to be my Lord and Saviour,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acceptance.</note> I know aſſuredly he is a Lord and Saviour, and he offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto poor ſinners, of whom I am chief, and I do accept of him to be my Lord and Saviour: I caſt my ſoul on him, I reſt my ſelf on him, my will and heart doth embrace and accept of him, only to be Lord and Saviour, him I do, and none but him I do accept.</p>
                  <p>3. A third is, <hi>I know aſſuredly that Jeſus Chriſt is my Lord and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Aſſurance.</note> 
                     <hi>my Saviour.</hi> Many of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> (and ſome of our own) bend this way, that the aſſentiall and proper Act of faith as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying, is aſſurance, and ſo they do define it, that it is <hi>an aſſurance, a full aſſurance, a full perſwaſion;</hi> whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,</p>
                  <p>That no man believes, until he can truly ſay I know that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is mine, I know that he dyed for me, I know that my ſinnes are pardoned.</p>
                  <p>It is not meet to take Armes, and ſtrike our own brethren; who I think in this rather, aimed to give us faith in its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then in its proper and ſubſtantial nature.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things muſt needs be confeſſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>aſſurance of faith may be poſſibly attained</hi> unto: God hath exhorted Chriſtians to ſtrive after <hi>aſſurance,</hi> yea, <hi>full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> yea, the <hi>riches of full aſſurance,</hi> and no doubt, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115662:24"/> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> but many a good Chriſtian, can ſay, (ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) I am verily perſwaded, and <hi>that Chriſt loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the <hi>aſſurance of faith is a moſt heavenly and comfortable condition.</hi> O the heavenly ſweetneſſe and divine ſolace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, affections! When I do not only poſſeſſe Chriſt, but I know that I do poſſeſſe him. When I do not only take him to be mine, but ſee him to be mine; when he ſaith to me, <hi>Be of good cheer, it is I, or, be of good comfort, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that believers ſhould ſtrive after this aſſurance, they ſhould not reſt in the meer acceptance, but ſhould contend in prayer, for the evidence, and reflection of this faith, that Chriſt is theirs, and they know him aſſuredly to be theirs. For though the eſtate of meere believing, is ſure, yet that of aſſurance is comfortable. That is a true day, when the Sun is riſing, but when it comes to the higheſt, the day is now glorious. Yet this I deny, that aſſurance (I mean, that reflexive perſwaſion that Chriſt is mine) is the eſſentiall or proper act of faith, that faith is not faith unleſſe it be aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>There are two acts of faith.</p>
                  <p>One without which faith cannot be juſtifying faith, and this is the acceptance or embracing of Chriſt, or that which ſome call reliance and recombency.</p>
                  <p>Another, which in time faith may produce; and ſo aſſurance is an act of faith, not the neceſſary act, but the circumſtantiall act as it were, not the vitall act, but the eminent act; aſſurance of faith, is fire blazing, the acceptance of faith is fire truly burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though not highly flaming; the more high faith doth riſe at any time, the leſſe doubtings there are, and the more aſſurance. And yet faith may be in truth, though it hath no reflexive aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but many doubtings: <hi>Why didſt thou doubt</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>O thou of little faith.</hi> Faith, though little Faith, and faith, though doubting, as fire though much ſmoke; and yet no doubting, if faith were eſſentially aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>O how many ſouls are there who prize none in the world like Chriſt, who love him with all their hearts, who honour him with the higheſt regards of a Lord, who hates the enemies of his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with a perfect hatred, who would not willingly offend, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115662:25"/> grieve him in the leaſt meaſure, who cleave unto him as the only rock of their ſalvation, who would not relinquiſh their intereſt in him for millions of worlds. And yet they weep with <hi>Mary,</hi> (becauſe) they cannot ſee their Lord; they conflict day and night with feares and doubts, they have not this reflexive evidence and aſſurance, that Chriſt is their Chriſt, that Jeſus is their Jeſus, that this Lord is their Lord. Yet ask them, are you willing to accept of him? O, none in the world rather or more: are you willing that he ſhould be your Saviour, he only is ſalvation? can you ſubmit to have him to be your Lord Chriſt? O bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (ſaith the ſoul) none to rule me but thou; none to ſave me but thou; thy blood is precious, and thy Lawes are righteous, and I could beſtow a thouſand hearts, and a thouſand lives if I had them, on thee, to be changed, guided, ruled, ordered by thee.</p>
                  <p>And thus the ſoul, though it cannot ſee him, yet it beleeves on him; it believes on him, though as yet it cannot ſay, <hi>that my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is mine, and I am his.</hi>

Faith doth not match the ſoul to the portion, to the benefits, but to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>You heare that God hath put ſalvation into Chriſts hand, he hath put remiſſion of ſins into his blood; there is eternal life to be had by him. Now if a perſon ſaith, I will have this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, which he hath purchaſed, but I will not have his perſon, I will have the remiſſion of ſins by his blood, but I care not for his perſon, I will have his righteouſneſſe by which I may ſtand before God, but I care not for his perſon; this now is no faith, it is no juſtifying faith.

                  <p>Firſt, that <hi>whole Chriſt,</hi> is the <hi>proper object of faith.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>how faith doth exerciſe it ſelf about whole Chriſt.</hi>

                     <hi>WHole Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>adequate and proper object;</hi> Chriſt you know (in reſpect of his perſon) is <hi>God and man,</hi> and he may be conſidered as a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or as a King We u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſay as a Saviour, and as a Lord. Now he offers himſelf in all theſe to ſinners: ſaith Chriſt there is <hi>no Name under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by which you can be ſaved but me,</hi> no Jeſus but my ſelf, and I have been the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who have offered my heart blood to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the pardon of your ſins, and ſalvation: <hi>I have ſatisfied my</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:115662:26"/> 
                     <hi>Father to the utmoſt,</hi> and have <hi>fulfilled all righteouſneſſe,</hi> Now I am willing to beſtow my ſelf on you, as one who can and will aſſuredly ſave you. But if you would have me to be your <hi>Prieſt</hi> to ſave you, you muſt alſo be willing to have me to be your <hi>Prophet</hi> to inſtruct you, and direct you; and to be your <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> to command you; you muſt reſigne up your ſelfe to my Scepter and Government; for I am a Lord as well as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and I will be taken in both, or elſe you ſhall have part in neither.</p>
                  <p>There be three things which lay hard on us.</p>
                  <p>One is the <hi>gilt of ſin,</hi> which expoſeth the ſoul to hell, and wrath, for which Chriſt is a Saviour and a Prieſt. <hi>He became a curſe for us, and bare our ſinnes,</hi> (that is) ſtood in our ſtead, and under-went that indignation, which elſe ſhould have lighted on us.</p>
                  <p>Another is the <hi>corruption or pollution of ſin,</hi> which breeds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity to Gods Will, and depraves the whole nature, for which Chriſt is a Saviour and a Prophet, (that is) he is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to informe the minde, and reforme the heart.</p>
                  <p>A third is the <hi>rebellion of ſin,</hi> riſing in ſinfull notions, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did delights and wayes, for which Chriſt is a Saviour and a King, (that is) he is to <hi>ſubdue thoſe iniquities,</hi> to give them the bill of divorce, <hi>to captivate all imaginations,</hi> and to bring the whole man into the ſubjection of himſelf; but then he will be Jeſus and Lord too; thou mayeſt not think that Chriſt muſt ſave thee, and ſin ſhall rule thee; thou muſt not think that he will pay thy debts, if thou wilt give thy heart and ſervice to ſinne and the world. How ridiculous is it to conceive that God ſhould raiſe up Chriſt, as the Pope raiſeth up his indulgences, only to keep or fetch ſouls out of Purgatory; as if Chriſt were given only to pay our ſcores, and not to rule our hearts, for no other end but to keep us out of priſon, that we might do nothing but ſin againſt God, becauſe Chriſt can take away the gilt of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Nay, <hi>whole Chriſt is eyed by faith, taken and received by faith.</hi> Do I feel my ſanfull gilt? I now by faith <hi>take Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom the father hath appointed, and offered to be my Prieſt, to be my ſurety, to beare my ſins, to ſtand 'twixt God and me? Do I feel my ſinfull nature and motions, I now <hi>take Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115662:26"/> Father hath appointed to be my <hi>Prophet and King:</hi> He hath undertaken to be the teacher of hearts, and conquerer of ſin; as ſo do I take him to be my Lord.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p>THerefore conſider in the ſecond place, <hi>How faith doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it ſelf about whole Chriſt:</hi> if you pleaſe I will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it in the particulars.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a <hi>Saviour and Prieſt:</hi> Thus faith looks on him, not only that he is ſo, but to be ſo to me; he was God and man, and dyed, and ſatisfied, and took away ſin; God proclaimes thus much, and offers him to me, here is the <hi>Saviour of the world, this is my well beloved Son,</hi> here is the <hi>blood of atonement and peace.</hi> What doth faith now? O faith takes hold on him; I acknowledge him, I receive him O Lord, to be my Saviour and Prieſt; not I, O Lord, not I could ever have ſuſteined thy wrath, or ſatisfied thy juſtice, I could never have made my own peace, I could never have blotted out the hand writing, I could never have paid my debts, but thou haſt <hi>ſet forth Christ to be the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for ſin.</hi> O Lord, I embrace him, my life is in his death, my healings in his ſufferings, my ſatisfaction in his obedience; in none but him; I reſt on none but him, on him do I believe, he hath ſatisfied to the utmoſt, and I truſt on him that he hath done it for me.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, the caſe ſtands thus, a man is borne in ſin, and he goes on in much ſin, (a long time) at length God awakens his conſcience, makes him to <hi>poſſeſſe the iniquities of his heels,</hi> of his birth, of his youth, of his age, of his life, and perhaps beſets the ſoul round about with ſome ſenſible dread of his infinite diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Now the man knowes not what to do: good Lord ſaith he, what a miſerable creature am I? here's ſin committed over and over, the Law broken, God provoked, conſcience raging, hell gaping; I am violated ſaith the Law, wronged ſaith Juſtice, thou haſt ſinned ſaith Conſcience, I will be ſatisfied ſaith the Lord, ſaith the poor ſoul, what ſhall become of me? what have I to quiet God? I can finde nothing, what ſhall I do to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115662:27"/> pacifie him? I cannot imagine it: If I ſay that I have not ſinned my conſcience tells me I lye, if I ſay I will not ſin hereafter, Why! yet how will this ſatisfie for former gilt? I tell you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that a heart brought to this ſenſible experience is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly oppreſſed, the very heart cracks, and the ſins of that ſoul ſnap a ſunder, under the ſenſe of manifold gilt, and Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>But then God comes in the Goſpel, and calls out to the poor and diſtreſſed ſinner, come hither ſaith God, I will ſhew thee a way of ſalvation? O how the ſoul liſtens to ſuch a meſſage! but how Lord can this be, what am I, or what can I do! No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaith God for thou art an enemy, and thou art without ſtrength: But I have laid <hi>Salvation upon one that is Mighty.</hi> Who is that Lord! <hi>It is my own Son,</hi> whom I have out of my love ſent into the world to be made man, and to dye, and ſatisfie for ſinners, to beare their iniquities, to anſwer for all their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and he is become a <hi>ſurety,</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and hath ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed his own ſoul, to be an offering for ſin, and I offer him unto thee, to be thy <hi>ſurety,</hi> to be thy <hi>Prieſt,</hi> to take away thy ſinnes: Now take him ſaith God to the ſoul and with him the diſcharge of thy ſins. Hereupon the ſoul being perſwaded of the truth of this good teſtimony, and with many teares admiring at the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of divine love and mercy, it doth now by <hi>faith cloſe in with Chriſt,</hi> put it ſelf on him, embraceth him with all the heart, as a ſufficient and perfect Saviour. As if the ſoul now faſtning it ſelf by faith on Chriſt in this reſpect ſhould thus be ſpeake the Lord.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, thou art pleaſed juſtly to charge my ſins upon my conſcience, I confeſſe and am aſhamed that I have thus ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee; yea, and I acknowledg that I am never able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee for thoſe ſins? But thou haſt appointed thine own Son to be my <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Prieſt,</hi> whoſe office it was to <hi>beare the ſins of the people,</hi> theſe ſins therefore which conſcience now chargeth upon me, I do by faith charge upon thine own Sonne, for he was <hi>made ſin for us;</hi> thou didſt ordaine him to be a ſurety, and therefore I beſeech thee Lord look for ſatisfaction of my debts in his precious blood, and take away thy curſe from my ſoul, for he was <hi>made a curſe for us,</hi> he did ſuſteine thy wrath in our ſteed to deliver from wrath: Now therefore O Lord! I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115662:27"/> put my ſoul only upon thy only Son, whom I take to be my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, him I offer up unto thee as my propitiation, I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but thy Son hath dyed for my ſins: I have provoked thee; but thy Son hath pacified thee, I have wronged thee, but thy Son hath ſatisfied thee; he did not die for his own ſins, but for my ſins, he was not made a curſe for himſelf, but for me, I lay hold on his blood to be my peace, and ſatisfaction and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As if a man were like to be carried to priſon for debt, and hunting up and down for a friend to ſtand for him, at length he findes one only man and him he brings to the creditor, and ſaith here's a man will pay you and ranſome me; ſo faith for a troubled and obliged ſinner to God, it findes out Chriſt, and ſaith, Lo Lord here is thy Son, who is my ſurety, he will diſcharge, he is my ranſome.</p>

                  <p>FOr Chriſt as a Saviour and King and Prophet and Lord what is the exerciſe of faith there? I tell you what I think of it.</p>
                  <p>It is a work of a believing heart, whereby it doth accept of Chriſt, to be the ſole teacher and ruler of heart and life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne up himſelf wholly to him, to be faſhioned as it were and guided by him. A man never comes to the truth of beleeving, but he ſhall finde this, <hi>that faith will change his Master:</hi> For faith changeth the heart, and the heart being once changed will quickly change its Lord: So that to believe on <hi>Christ</hi> as a <hi>King,</hi> as a <hi>Lord,</hi> as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> it is to admit him to give him up the whole man into his hands to his holy and ſpiritual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as if the heart ſhould ſay thus much, thou art a <hi>Holy Chriſt</hi> and thou art he who art to <hi>reigne,</hi> now I take thee to be my Holy Lord, and I reſigne up my ſelfe, I paſſeover my ſelfe unto thee, I will have no Lord but thee, and I do with all my heart accept of thee to make me <hi>Holy, as thou art Holy,</hi> and to ſubdue this vile heart of mine, and to rule in me, by thy bleſſed and mighty Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <head>SECT. V.</head>
                  <p>THus briefly of the <hi>immediate object of faith,</hi> on which faith immediately looks <hi>(viz) the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> to take and receive <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour.</hi> This is true faith; yet by the way note a few things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that this <hi>taking is with all the heart,</hi> it is not a pretended taking, a diſſembled work; there is a taking of Chriſt with the tongue, and a taking of him with the heart: O no, when true faith takes Chriſt, it brings in the very ſtrength of the ſoul: O Lord Jeſus, I do embrace thee, accept of thee with all my ſoul, with all my might, and with all my affections.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this <hi>taking of Chriſt is of all Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>Lord</hi> as well as <hi>Jeſus:</hi> when the heart is made ſenſible of ſin and Satan, and world, and Chriſt, and now falls off from them, I will have no more to do with you, I will ſerve you no longer, <hi>Chriſt</hi> only ſhall be my <hi>Saviour,</hi> and he only ſhall be my <hi>Lord,</hi> I will put my ſoul under his Scepter and Government.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this <hi>taking of Chriſt is onely of Chriſt.</hi> For it is a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall taking,</hi> which conſiſts of unity: one (they ſay in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks) is divided in it ſelf, and divided from all beſides it ſelf; ſo is it in faiths taking of Chriſt, <hi>One Faith, One Lord,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. It takes Chriſt ſo as none with Chriſt, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Chriſt: The <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had moſt of them a wife, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, it is not ſo here, <hi>Faith</hi> doth match with an abſolute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all other matches. It is not the ſoul, and Chriſt, and ſin: nor the ſoul and Chriſt, and the world: nor the ſoul, and Chriſt, and the Devil: it is not the ſoul and Chriſt in chief, and ſinne in ſervice as a deputy, or a corrivall, a ſecondary thing, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this <hi>taking</hi> is freed from <hi>miſtaking.</hi> Faith knowes what it doth, it ſees its way it underſtands, 1. Who that is whom it takes. 2. Upon what termes he will be taken. 3 Its grounds of taking.</p>
                  <p>Firſt who it is, <hi>(viz.) the Son of God, God and man,</hi> a moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon, a mighty Redeemer, and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, upon what termes, <hi>(viz.)</hi> He will not come in by the by, he will not be taken as a vaſſaile, as a captive, as a drudge: he will not be taken for baſe and changeable reaſons, meerly to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115662:28"/> ſtop a gap in the conſcience, or only in faire weather, but he will be taken as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> to command all the heart, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the wayes, to rule our very thoughts, he will be taken for his own ſake, out of a judicious love and eſtimation of his perſon, he will be taken with all the eſtates and conditions that befall on the <hi>croſſe crucified,</hi> as well as in the way to <hi>Hieruſalem magnified;</hi> as one perſecuted and diſtreſſed on earth, as well as one raiſed and glorified in heaven; and thus true faith takes Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, upon what grounds, <hi>viz. upon Gods offer of Chriſt and promiſe,</hi> that <hi>whoſoever believes on him, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>on his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that we ſhould <hi>believe on the Name of his Son;</hi> whereupon faith brings in the ſoul to Chriſt, it believeth that God ſaith true, that he doth not call upon men, he doth not command men, he doth not promiſe men, and all this to delude men; ſo that if you ſhould ask faith what warrant had you to bring in ſuch a ſoul to Chriſt? Why ſaith faith, God revealed, and offered his Sonne, and commanded me to believe, and promiſed not to caſt off any that come, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this <hi>taking</hi> is reſolved againſt <hi>untaking.</hi> All takings are not of the ſame force and power; if I take a ſervant, I take him ſo, that upon good reaſons and occaſions I can put him off againe; but if I take a wife, there can be no untaking on my part, unleſs God takes her, I muſt never forſake her. Faith takes Chriſt this way, to be a <hi>Saviour for ever,</hi> to be a <hi>Head,</hi> an <hi>Husband,</hi> a <hi>Lord for ever:</hi> I obſerve that there are two kindes of taking <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a <hi>Lord,</hi> one is <hi>compulſory</hi> and violent, as when an enemy is made to rule, a man in a ſickneſſe, in a terror of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in a day of wrath, in an expectation of death, he will take Chriſt to be his Lord, he will ſay, Oh! ſinne is vile, I abhor it, I will become a new man, I will have none but the Lord Chriſt, and he only ſhall be my Lord, and hereupon the man ſets about the work of ſhewing that Chriſt is his Lord, he will command his ſervants to pray, to heare, to read, to keep the Sabbath, &amp;c. Yet this man as ſoon as Gods hand is off, as ſoon as ever he is freed from his bands, he will like a lewd apprentiſe, break looſe from his Lord and Maſter, he will ſerve Chriſt no longer, he will to his ſins again to the world again, to his baſe ſociety again &amp;c. Why? becauſe this accepting was only violent, and no actions
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115662:29"/> are ſtedfaſt, or conſtant, whoſe cauſes are compelling and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                  <p>Another is <hi>ingenious of faith,</hi> and this taking of Chriſt, is grounded onely in Chriſt, in its excellencies, beauties, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which are not like the <hi>light of a candle,</hi> this houre ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cleare, and the next, none at all, but like <hi>light in the Sunne,</hi> ſtill abiding and remaining; and therefore, when a man doth by <hi>faith, take Chriſt,</hi> he <hi>takes</hi> him <hi>for ever:</hi> for faith can never change for the better, and it ſees ſtedfaſt reaſon <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>cleave to Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I come to the <hi>conſequent object of faith,</hi> and that is, <hi>remiſſion of ſinnes and righteouſneſſe,</hi> and whatſoever good comes from Chriſt,</p>
                  <p>For thus it is, <hi>faith</hi> doth order its motions, or actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>word;</hi> Now the word reveales, and offers Chriſt firſt, and then the benefits next. It is not, whoſoever beleeves eternal life ſhall have Chriſt the Sonne of God, but <hi>whoſoever beleeves on the Sonne of God, ſhall have eternal life;</hi> Nor is it, whoſoever beleeves the remiſſion of ſinnes, ſhall have Chriſt, but <hi>whoſoever beleeves in Chriſt, ſhall have the Remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet when faith hath made the ſoule to take Chriſt, it goes then from the <hi>perſon</hi> to the <hi>portion,</hi> from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the good in Chriſt, and by him; <hi>for if Chriſt be ours, all is ours,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</p>

                  <p>I Will therefore ſpeak a word of faith, as converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, Firſt, <hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the pardon or remiſſion of ſinnes, Conſider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That remiſſion of ſinnes, is an Action of God, acquitting the gilt and the puniſhment, ſo that he will never reckon with the ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more in a judicial way for thoſe ſinnes which are pardoned.</hi> As when the <hi>King</hi> throughly pardons a Malefactor, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115662:29"/> him, and takes off the gilt, (we ſpeak of it in reſpect of redundancy) that it ſhall not now prejudice the perſon any longer; ſo doth <hi>God,</hi> when he pardons ſinne: Though he doth not in this annihilate the ſinne, (that is) make that to be no ſinne, which was ſinne, yet he doth prejudice ſin (that is) he takes off the guilt, that it ſhall never redound to the damnation of the ſinner, no nor to his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath procured remiſſion or pardon of ſinne for us, hence, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>In whom you have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſſe of your ſinnes. His blood was ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> Mat. 26 (that is) he did die, and by his death hath merited, and procured our pardon and diſcharge: <hi>God offering Chriſt,</hi> offers with him the <hi>purchaſe of Christ,</hi> viz. the <hi>pardon of ſinnes;</hi> If you will take my Sonne, I will pardon your ſins. Now faith inclines the ſoul, which is ſenſible of its ſinful guilt, to put it ſelf on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for the diſcharge of them: As the wife looks for none, and goes to none but to her husband to diſcharge her debts; ſo faith goes to none for to procure remiſſion of ſinnes, but only to Chriſt, and on him doth it reſt. O <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Faith,</hi> thou didſt take theſe my ſinful debts upon thee, and thou didſt undertake to ſatisfie for them, and to get them to be blotted out, yea, and I know that thou didſt make a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Now I renounce all hope of pardon from any thing in me, and do reſt my ſoule on thy precious blood, truſting that it was ſhed for the remiſſion of my ſins; I have taken thee to be my Chriſt, and therefore I commit the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of my ſinful debt, to thy full ſatisfaction and ſufferings. Put the caſe to a beleeving heart, you have many ſinful debts to anſwer for, ſinnes before converſion, and ſinnes after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; ſins of ignorance, and ſinnes of knowledge; theſe ſinnes have that in them, which bindes you over to wrath and curſe, now to whom doth it belong to pardon theſe ſinnes; your ſoul anſwers, to God, <hi>Who can forgive ſinnes but God only?</hi> And <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy ſins, &amp;c.</hi> yea, but for whoſe ſake will God pardon them? the ſoul anſwers, onely for <hi>Christ Jeſus ſake,</hi> for he did ſhed his blood for their remiſſion, and therefore faith goes with the ſoul to Chriſt, and ſaith, O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115662:30"/> Saviour, thy blood was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinnes, and thou haſt invited all that are <hi>heavy laden to come unto thee,</hi> and <hi>thou wilt eaſe them:</hi> Thou ſayeſt, <hi>if any man ſinne,</hi>

                  <p>Beloved, this know, that <hi>God</hi> doth never <hi>Juſtifie</hi> a man, nor will ever <hi>ſave</hi> a man, who hath not a <hi>perfect Righteouſneſſe,</hi> for he is a <hi>Righteous God,</hi> and will not pronounce the ſinner guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; his <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> muſt be ſatisfied in all points, or elſe the ſinner ſhall never come to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſoul of a perſon is marvellouſly diſtreſſed, when it ſeriouſly thinks of this; How ſhall I ſtand before the great and holy God another day, being by nature ſo wholly ſinful, and at the beſt being but defectively and imperfectly good? But faith in this caſe brings the ſoul to Chriſt, and in him it findes a moſt <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>abſolute righteouſneſſe:</hi> For whom ſaith the ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſoul? for thee, ſaith Faith; what for me? yea <hi>for thee,</hi> for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt was made the righteouſneſſe of</hi>

                     <hi>God for us,</hi> and that <hi>he was made ſinne for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi> So that if thou wouldſt <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> have ſuch a righteouſneſſe, as may anſwer the Law, and ſatisfie God, and which God will accept for Juſtification: Thou muſt by faith get out of thy ſelf, and lay hold on that righteouſneſs which is in Chriſt. As <hi>Paul, I account all things but dung that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by Faith,</hi> Phil. 3. 8, 9.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:115662:30"/>
                  <p> There is a twofold righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>inherent,</hi> which is <hi>in us,</hi> and this <hi>imperfect,</hi> it can never juſtifie us in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>Another is <hi>imputed,</hi> which is not <hi>in us,</hi> yet it is <hi>for us;</hi> And this is the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> both in his nature, and in his obedience; <hi>Active,</hi> and <hi>Paſſive,</hi> which God reckons unto him who doth beleeve in Chriſt, of which the Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 12. c. 5. &amp; on this doth faith reſt only in the matter of juſtication. Though inherent righteouſneſſe be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely required to ſalvation, yet no righteouſneſſe but that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which is Chriſts, and is imputed to beleevers, is the matter of our juſtification. When a ſinner comes to account it with God, he can never ſay, Lord, Lo here I am, ſee if there be any ſin in my perſon, or defect in my holineſſe, I will expoſtulate with thee upon bare termes; I have not offended thee, or if I have, here's grace enough to anſwer for me, my heart is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleane, my duties at all times in every reſpect, for matter and manner, have been performed juſt as thou requireſt in thy holy Law, enter into judgement with me if thou pleaſeſt; I will be tryed by my own holineſſe, by my own goodneſſe. O no, there can be no ſuch thing, no ſinner can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced juſt this way, ever the <hi>Saints</hi> muſt <hi>caſt their crowns to the ground, and give glory to the Lamb who only is worthy.</hi> For when we come to the point of juſtification before God, we muſt <hi>renounce our own righteouſneſſe as filthy rags,</hi> we muſt cry out, <hi>enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as they who were in danger, <hi>fled to the hornes of the Altar for their lives,</hi> ſo muſt we, if we would be juſtified, fly by faith to the Altar of Chriſts perfect righteouſneſſe, and ſo doth faith, when it would preſent the perſon of a ſinner perfect and unblameable before God; It doth bring him unto Chriſt, and ſaith before God, <hi>I beleeve in him to be the Lord my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, That beleeving, or faith, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered four wayes; either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> as a ſimple habit, or quality of grace, apt to change the unbelievingneſſe of the heart, and to ſend forth the acts of truſting and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <note place="margin">3. Premiſes.</note> Thus faith is not the only way of ſalvation, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe other habits are required as well as faith, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not in faith, (abſolutely conſidered) any merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dignity (of it ſelf) to challenge ſalvation. We ſay that a Ring is worth a hundred pound, not abſolutely conſidered, not that the gold which makes the Ring, amounts to that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but in reſpect of the Diamond ſet in that Ring; ſo <hi>faith</hi> is a <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>wonderful price (much more precious then gold)</hi> Not ſo much in reſpect of it ſelf, as if it did by its own natural dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cauſe our Juſtification, and ſalvation, but in reſpect of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe perſon it takes, and on whoſe righteouſneſſe it doth rely; ſo though this be true, we are <hi>juſtified by faith,</hi> yet this is as true, we are <hi>not juſtified for faith,</hi> but <hi>for Christ,</hi> on whom faith doth truſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Actually,</hi> (that is) for the very <hi>act of beleeving: Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Birtius,</hi> and ſome of that cut, do ſay, That <hi>not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Christ</hi> is that which juſtifieth, but the act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving on it, is that which is <hi>imputed</hi> in our Juſtification. A <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt</hi> they do grant, but 'tis the <hi>act of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving</hi> on this, which (by <hi>divine acceptation</hi> or favour)
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115662:31"/> is <hi>imputed for righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: by <hi>his blood we are juſtified,</hi> Rom. 5. 9. By his <hi>obedience are we made righteous,</hi> verſe 19. If this doth juſtifie us, then faith as an act doth not, unleſſe we will be doubly juſtified.</p>
               <p>Secondly, no works of ours, before or after grace, do juſtifie us, but the act of faith is one of theſe. <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Correlatively</hi> (that is) with relation to Chriſt and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and in this reſpect faith is the onely way: one ſaith well, faith doth not juſtifie as an <hi>action,</hi> but as a <hi>paſſion;</hi> his <note place="margin">Bucer.</note> meaning is this, not <hi>faith apprehending,</hi> but the thing <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith</hi> doth <hi>juſtifie:</hi> It is true, I muſt by faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Chriſt if I will be ſaved; but it is not the apprehenſion which ſaves, but he who is apprehended is the cauſe of my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If I were like to be drowned in the water, I muſt put forth my hand to him, who ſtands and reacheth out his hand unto me; yet it is not the meer putting forth of my hand which ſaves me from drowning, but his hand which is laid hold on by mine, which draws me forth, and ſo I am preſerved, both muſt meet, but the cauſe is in him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Inſtrumentally,</hi> or in reſpect of office; you know well how to diſtinguiſh 'twixt <hi>actions</hi> a man doth <hi>as a man,</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> which a man doth <hi>as an officer:</hi> If a man be condemned, and ready for execution, and one comes from the King with the meſſage of pardon, the delivering of this meſſage is an act of his employment and office, not of his abſolute nature as a man only. Thus it is with <hi>faith,</hi> it ſends out ſome actions, as an <hi>abſolute grace,</hi> and it performes others as a <hi>grace in office,</hi> as an inſtrument deſigned and deputed; It juſtifies us in this latter reſpect; not that it is the matter or cauſe which cleares all for us with God, but becauſe it is the inſtrument, laying hold on him who doth this for us: As the hand is ſaid to cloath the body, not that the hand is any cloathing (for a man doth not weare his hand) but becauſe it is the inſtrument to put on our cloathing: or as the cup is ſaid to quench our thirſt, not that the mettal of the cup can go down and ſatisfie that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural appetite, but becauſe it holds that wine or liquor which doth quench; ſo doth <hi>faith juſtifie</hi> a ſinner, not as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115662:32"/> the <hi>object,</hi> not as the <hi>cauſe,</hi> but as the <hi>inſtrument</hi> (that is) as the hand of the ſoule, laying hold on the <hi>Robes of Chriſts righteouſneſſe,</hi> putting on that garment of his, and as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, receiving, and holding, and bringing to the ſoul that precious blood of Chriſt, which onely can (immediately) ſatisfie God, and appeaſe a thirſty conſcience.</p>
               <p>2. Againe we muſt diſtinguiſh of the manner and peculiar habitudes, or reſpect of things unto ſalvation; ſome things <note place="margin">A twofold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of things.</note> have a <hi>reference to ſalvation by way of proper cauſality,</hi> which have in them a meritorious reaſon, for the proper dignity of which a perſon is juſtified and ſaved; And in this reſpect we ſay, that <hi>beleeving in Jeſus Chriſt is the only method, and way of ſalvation.</hi> Not that faith can (from its own worth) diſpute and challenge from God, but becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (who is the object of faith) hath as a cauſe <hi>merited</hi> our pardon, juſtification and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Other things have a <hi>reference by way of order;</hi> As ſuppoſe a man were to be Knighted by the King, to obtaine this Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he muſt come to the Court, and ſtoop down on his knee, and ſo receive that honour; This acceſſe to the Court, and humbling on his knee, is not a matter of merit or cauſe, but only of order and condition: In this latter reſpect, we deny not but <hi>good works</hi> look <hi>towards ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lvation,</hi> and are required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Not as any <hi>cauſe (Chriſt only is the cauſe)</hi> but as <hi>conditions,</hi> and <hi>orderly ſteps,</hi> and wayes, which we muſt tread, if we will be ſaved, <hi>via ad regnum, non cauſa regnandi.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bernard.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When we ſay, that <hi>beleeving in Chriſt Jeſus is the onely way to be ſaved;</hi> you muſt not underſtand it ſo, as if <hi>no other grace</hi> were required from a man but <hi>faith only,</hi> but thus, There is no other grace which layes hold on Chriſt (who is the cauſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) but faith only: As it was with the <hi>father of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal,</hi> when he <hi>met</hi> his ſonne, falling down on his knees, he preſently <hi>forgave him:</hi> but before he <hi>brought him into his houſe,</hi> he did <hi>cloath him with other garments:</hi> So doth <hi>God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> upon our humbling and believing, freely confer on us <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins for his Chriſts ſake;</hi> yet before he brings us to heaven, he doth inveſt our ſouls with the ſingular <hi>graces</hi> of his <hi>holy Spirit;</hi> yea, though <hi>juſtification</hi> be not <hi>ſanctification,</hi> yet where God doth the one, he ever beſtowes and works the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115662:32"/> other. Therefore I pray you remember to diſtinguiſh 'twixt theſe two, juſtification, and ſanctification. The perſon juſtified and to be ſaved. Though this be moſt true, that there is no other <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of our <hi>juſtification</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but only <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and there is no other <hi>inſtrument</hi> to lay hold on this, but <hi>faith,</hi> yet this is as true, that the perſon juſtified, and to be ſaved, hath <hi>more graces in him beſides his faith;</hi> though there be not a <hi>co-operation of faith,</hi> and <hi>other graces,</hi> to <hi>justifie;</hi> yet there is a <hi>co-exiſtance of faith</hi> and <hi>other graces,</hi> in the <hi>perſon juſtified.</hi> Thou muſt have a <hi>good heart</hi> as well as a <hi>good Chriſt,</hi> and an <hi>holy life,</hi> as well as a <hi>precious faith,</hi> or elſe thou ſhalt never come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. You know that in the body of man, there be <hi>Eyes</hi> to ſee, and <hi>Eares</hi> to hear, and <hi>Hands</hi> to take, and <hi>Feet</hi> to go, of all theſe which are in the body, yet no members are deputed to ſee, but the eyes, nevertheleſſe the eye muſt not ſay of the eares, <hi>I have no need of thee,</hi> nor the hand to the foot, <hi>I have no need of thee:</hi> it is granted, that no member ſees but the eye, eates but the mouth, walks but the feet, layes hold on but the hands. Their offices are ſingular, yet their con-corporation is neceſſary. So, no grace but faith, pitcheth on Chriſt, layes hold on him as the cauſe of ſalvation, yet there is need of other graces in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſaved. There muſt be <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>godly ſorrow,</hi> and <hi>true fear,</hi> and <hi>lively hope,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>zeal, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>eſtate is changed,</hi> only by the blood of Chriſt, but if we will be ſaved, the <hi>perſon muſt alſo be changed</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of Christ.</hi>

                  <p>THeſe things being thus premiſed. I ſhall now give you ſome arguments, by which the truth of the aſſertion ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is <hi>no other way</hi> to be ſaved, but this <hi>(viz.) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Jeſus Chriſt. Ergo,</hi> it is the <hi>only way.</hi> Three things I take as granted Hypotheſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that there is a <hi>Salvation for a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that there is a <hi>way tending thereto,</hi> as a <hi>meritorious</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. Arguments.</note> 
                     <hi>cauſe of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:115662:33"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, that <hi>every man is a ſinner, for all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, Rom.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p>Now then, know that there are but two wayes of life, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Two wayes of life.</note> to which there is a double Covenant. Firſt, one <hi>Legal.</hi> Secondly, the other <hi>Evangelical.</hi> The <hi>Legal Covenant</hi> is, <hi>do this and live;</hi> the <hi>Evangelical Covenant</hi> is, <hi>believe and live.</hi> The Legal Covenant grounds ſalvation in <hi>our own perſons,</hi> and the Evangelical, in the <hi>righteouſneſſe of another perſon.</hi> And theſe Covenants are oppoſite, that one cannot conſiſt with the other. For (and mark this) though the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> may, and do, and ſhall conſiſt, as the Law is a word of rule for obedience, yet they cannot poſſibly conſiſt, is the Covenant of juſtification, and ſalvation: (that is) whoſoever will ſtand to the Covenant of works, to be juſtified by it, he rejects the Covenant of grace, and ſo <hi>Econtra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well then, this being true, that <hi>our life</hi> is to be had by the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> or of <hi>Grace,</hi> I will briefly ſhew unto you that we ſinners can never be juſtified and ſaved, by the Legal Covenant, which if I clear, then it will be evident, that <hi>our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is only by faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then, all the poſſibility to be juſtified and ſaved by the Legall Covenant, ariſeth from one of theſe grounds <hi>(viz)</hi> either becauſe,</p>
                  <p>That there is a fulneſſe and exactneſſe in inherent holineſſe. <note place="margin">3. Things.</note> That there is a dignity and efficacy in actual obedience, which they call <hi>good works.</hi> That there is a latitude, or ſufficiency of duty, to fulfil the Law, which may be conceived to be in a regenerate perſon; but none of theſe can juſtifie and ſave; <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, <hi>viz inherent holineſſe,</hi> this holineſſe is that <note place="margin">1. Inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> which is wrought in our whole ſoul, by the Spirit of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, of wicked he makes us good, and of unholy, he makes us ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and according to the ſeverall degrees of it is the perſon leſſe or more holy. Now this we ſay, that though the <hi>juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> hath this <hi>infuſed inherent holineſſe:</hi> Yet this is not that which <note place="margin">Cannot juſtifie and ſave.</note> can juſtifie him before God, (that is) for the dignity of which he can ſtand ſo before the judgement of God, as to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced juſt and righteous, and ſo acquitted, which I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>1. That
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115662:33"/> can never be the cauſe of our juſtification, which is <hi>defective</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and <hi>imperfect,</hi> and leaves yet the <hi>perſon in ſome meaſure ſinful.</hi> I <note place="margin">4. Reaſons of it.</note> cannot in the Court of Juſtice, be pronounced <hi>perfectly juſt,</hi> for <hi>that righteouſneſſe</hi> which is <hi>imperfectly just,</hi> no more then he can in a ſtrict court be reputed to make full ſatisfaction, who hath not paid halfe his debt, or to be throughly well, who is ſcarſe able to walk three turnes in the Chamber: But that <hi>holineſs</hi> which is in us, <hi>inherent holineſſe,</hi> is very <hi>imperfect,</hi> (I ſpeak of that which is in us here on earth) it is not adequate, or parallel to the <hi>whole will of God,</hi> which requires <hi>perfection of degrees,</hi> as well as of <hi>parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it is imperfect, is as cleare as day.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is at <hi>combate with ſin. Ergo,</hi> it is not perfect: the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is good, for whiles one contrary is mixed with the other, there is ſtill imperfection; <hi>Sinne</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> are <hi>contrary,</hi> and <hi>conflictings</hi> ſhew <hi>imperfection,</hi> as <hi>victory</hi> notes <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that which may be <hi>encreaſed,</hi> is not <hi>perfect,</hi> but our inherent holineſſe may receive more encreaſe: Hence thoſe many exhortations <hi>to perfect holineſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 7 1. and to <hi>labor after perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all the <hi>parts of holineſſe are imperfect. Faith</hi> is not ſo clear an eye, nor <hi>Hope</hi> ſo fixed an Anchor, nor <hi>Love</hi> ſo pure a ſtreame, but that each of them need additions of degrees, of ſtrength, of help: the <hi>Moon</hi> when it draweth into neareſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the <hi>Sun,</hi> and is filled with the longeſt beames of communicated light, it hath yet her ſpots, which like ſo many reproaches ſtick in the heart of her; ſo is it with the holieſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on earth, with the largeſt meaſures of inherent graces, he hath yet great meaſures of ſinne, which like ſo many ſpots, do blemiſh and diſable the ſoul to ſtand perfectly pure and juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of God.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>righteouſneſſe by which we are juſtified is manifeſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. and what that righteouſneſſe is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he expreſſeth in <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>even the righteouſneſſe of God which is by faith of Jeſus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe.

                  <p> That cannot be the <hi>cauſe of our juſtification and ſalvation,</hi> upon which the <hi>conſcience dares not to reſt</hi> in the ſecret agonies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, or in the eminent houres of death: when the ſoul is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conflict with the wrath of God, being wounded with the ſenſe of ſinne, and cited as it were before the tribunal of Gods holy and ſtrict juſtice, dares it then to put it ſelf ſeriouſly, and in good earneſt upon its <hi>own holineſſe,</hi> to make <hi>its peace,</hi> to <hi>be its propitiation,</hi> to ſatisfie the trials and demands of Gods juſtice?

                  </p>
                  <p>I know this fields is very large, I will not expatiate, but ſpeak in a word of it, with a proper reſpect to the thing in hand, I prove the thing thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No man (ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall) <hi>can performe works, in that perfection which the Law of God requires,</hi> under the paine of eternal damnation. The perfection of good works (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrict exigence of the Law, conſiſts eſpecially in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is, that a man be able to performe them with all of his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115662:34"/> heart, and with a plenary love, without the intervening, or ſliping in of any evil inclination, or motion which abates that due and required intenſion, or in any meaſure ſprinkleth or taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with any defilement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another is, that a man is to perform good works in that manner, with a perpetual and conſtant ten our or courſe all his life. Thoſe two are the ingredients of perfection, as appears by that of Chriſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And that of <hi>Paul, He is curſed that doth not continue in all that is written, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 3. 10. Theſe are the conditions of works legally good, and which muſt <hi>juſtifie a man,</hi> if he will be <hi>juſtified</hi> according to <hi>the legal Covenant.</hi> But who can performe ſuch perfect and good works? <hi>Adam</hi> might have done them, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> did; but what one ſinner can? <hi>who can ſay, my heart is cleane,</hi> and that we <hi>do not in many things offend all? Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>I am carnal,</hi> but <hi>the Law is ſpiritual: The good that he would do, he could not do, and the evil which he would not do, that did he do.</hi> Good Lord! how often are we at a loſſe in our moſt retired me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and how our hearts lie flat on earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when our eyes look towards heaven in prayer? For one good work that we do, how many bad which we ſhould not do? like boyes, for one faire line, twenty with blots and blurs; or like the Archers, whereas they hit the mark once, they miſſe it a hundred times: Let us but caſt the accounts of our ill works with the good, and we ſhall finde with ſhame and ſorrow, that our good works are not equal with our bad in number, nor ſo ſtrong in dignity to wipe out the bad; but the bad, as they are more for number, ſo their cry of gilt is more merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to caſt both our perſons and all our works before the judgement ſeat of God, then the good to ingratiate or merit for us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What <hi>proportion 'twixt our works, and 'twixt our pardon and ſalvation?</hi> If <hi>Jacob be leſſe then the leaſt of outward bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,</hi> Good God! how far more unworthy are we of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, yea of the <hi>Eternal?</hi> When we have done all, we have not done more then duty, and that can never be <hi>merit,</hi> which is but <hi>duty;</hi> nay, when we have done all we can, we have not done our duty, we are but <hi>unprofitable ſervants,</hi> and that which failes of <hi>duty,</hi> comes ſhort of <hi>dignity</hi> or <hi>merit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115662:35"/>
                  <p> It is true, that God commands, accepts, delights in, will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly reward good works; what, for their own ſake? No, for his mercies ſake he will ſave the man whoſe heart is holy, and whoſe life is fruitful; What, for the <hi>works ſake?</hi> No, but for his <hi>Chriſts ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, but that there is ſome relation 'twixt good works and ſalvation, as between the <hi>meanes</hi> and the <hi>end;</hi> but there is not that relation as 'twixt an <hi>efficient cauſe, and an effect;</hi> for the efficient cauſe of our ſalvation is only <hi>Gods grace</hi> and favour; Nor, as 'twixt a <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> and the <hi>reward,</hi> for the <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of our ſalvation, is only the <hi>obedience of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Nor, as 'twixt an <hi>apprehenſive cauſe,</hi> (may I uſe ſuch an improper ſpeech) for that only is <hi>faith,</hi> the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſalvation, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There is not in regenerate men ſuch an adequation or full <note place="margin">3. Noe ability to keep the whole Law wholly.</note> anſwerableneſſe of duty, as to <hi>keep and fulfil the Law,</hi> as it is the <hi>Covenant of life and ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are divers Arguments to cleare this, I will touch one or two. <note place="margin">3. Reaſons.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Imperfect actions do not fulfil a perfect Rule,</hi> no more then a ſhort line anſwers a long copy, or a line partly crooked doth that which is ſtreight: But the duties which regenerate men perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are imperfect actions, for as much as they flow from an imperfect agent, <hi>viz.</hi> from the ſoul of a Chriſtian, which is partly ſpiritual, and partly carnal not wholly ſpiritual, nor wholy carnal; even from this doth the Apoſtle conclude the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (for us) to fulfil the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>viz. from the weakneſs or infirmity of the fleſh</hi> (that is) of the old man not yet fully purged and changed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If any man could perfectly fulfil the Law,</hi> then <hi>ſome man had no need of Chriſt,</hi> either to be his <hi>Redeemer,</hi> or to be his <hi>Interceſſor;</hi> for a Redeemer and Interceſſour is, in caſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and failing, and ſo Chriſt ſhould be to a regenerate perſon, at leaſt an idle and fruitleſſe interceſſour; for as much as it doth appertaine to his interceſſion, to pacifie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile, and ingratiate: but what uſe of this, where all things and ſervices are juſt already, as they ſhould be without any animadvertency of the Law againſt them? But <hi>Chriſt is an Interceſſor</hi> even for the <hi>Saints. He makes interceſſion for us,</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:115662:35"/> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. and Saint <hi>John</hi> implies that an <hi>Advocate is for a ſinner, only for him,</hi> 1 John 2. 1. <hi>If any man ſinne, we have an Advocate, &amp;c.</hi> If for a ſinner only, then for a tranſgreſſor of the Law, and if for a tranſgreſſor of the Law, then not for one who doth perfectly fulfil it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the <hi>juſt muſt live by faith,</hi> Then he cannot <hi>perfectly fulfil the Law;</hi> for then he might <hi>live by his works,</hi> but the <hi>juſt ſhall live by his faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 11. <hi>That no man is juſtified by the Law in the ſight of God, it is evident, for the juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> Mark the place <hi>(ſhall live by faith)</hi> If it comes to the matter of life and death, then farewel works, <hi>Curſed is every one that doth not continue in all that is written to do them;</hi> If he will ſave his life, he muſt get him faith to fly to mercy and Chriſt: yea, and mark of whom he ſpeaks this, It is not of a perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, but it is of the <hi>juſt,</hi> even the <hi>juſt muſt live by his faith,</hi> (that is) <hi>By Christ,</hi> on which faith doth reſt, not by his own merits, works, obedience.</p>
                  <p>Now, put all this together, there are but two ways to ſave a man, either by faith in Chriſt, or elſe by the obſervance of the Law, But none can obſerve the Law, ſo as to be juſtified by it; Becauſe, 1. His holineſſe is ſhort. 2. His works ineffectual. 3. His performances unanſwerable, <hi>Ergo,</hi> to beleeve in Chriſt is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every mouth is ſtopped (by the Law) and all the world is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gilty before God, Therefore by the Deeds of the Law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight, for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin,</hi> Rom. 3. 19, 20. Suppoſe a man had many great debts, and ſeveral poore friends, and he ſeeks to one of them, good ſir be bound for me, alas ſaith he, all my eſtate will not reach or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſatisfie half of what thou oweſt; Then he goes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; Sir be you pleaſed to engage your ſelf; Alas, ſaith he, I am ſo poore that the Creditor will not take my word; Even thus it is when a man will runne to ſomething in himſelf, to juſtifie him before God; alas, ſaith holineſſe, I am not able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ſaith good works, God may finde reaſon enough to diſcard us: Therefore, ſaith Faith, <hi>To Chriſt, To Chriſt, None but Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>SEcondly, <hi>All that can juſtifie and ſave a man, is only to be found in Chriſt,</hi> as in the <hi>meritorious cauſe, Ergo,</hi> the only way to be ſaved, is to be beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt. Hence is Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>The Chaptaine of our ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 5. 18. <hi>The Author of eternal ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be two things, which if a man had, he ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, one is the <hi>forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes.

                  </p>
                  <p>Another is, the <hi>poſſeſſion of a moſt compleat righteouſneſſe,</hi> by which he might ſtand and appeare perfectly juſt before the judgement ſeat of God; ſo that if divine juſtice ſhould look on it, with the exacteſt eye, yet it were every way unſpotted and full. Now theſe two are to be found only in Chriſt, and by him,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> It is the purchaſe of his blood one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore often in Scripture aſſigned thereto. Thou canſt not with all thy teares wipe off (meritoriouſly) the leaſt of thy ſinnes, nor with all thy grace, buy out the pardon of thy preſent failings. <hi>All Remiſſion is by blood,</hi> by the only <hi>blood of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> which juſtifies and ſaves us, is only in Chriſt, <hi>He is made righteouſneſſe to us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience, many were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous;</hi> ſee verſe 21. <hi>Grace reignes through righteouſneſſe unto eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know that this Point of <hi>imputed righteouſneſſe,</hi> is the great quarrel 'twixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſhall therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the handling of it to the Uſes, where I may more fitly clear our doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Now put things together, Whatſoever will ſave us, is in Chriſt, And faith is the only grace to conjoyne us with Chriſt, and therefore, To <hi>believe in Jeſus Chriſt is the only way to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>How <hi>preciouſly deare</hi> (then) unto you ſhould the <hi>Miniſtry of the Goſpel</hi> be, which is the inſtrument of God, to produce that faith, which layes hold on that Chriſt, by whom only we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 17. and <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. <hi>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is an enemy to his <hi>own ſalvation,</hi> who <hi>ſlights the preaching of the Goſpel;</hi> and he is an enemy to the <hi>ſalvation of others,</hi> who labours to <hi>oppreſſe</hi> and <hi>extinguiſh it:</hi> for if ſalvation be by faith in Chriſt, and that faith depends on the Goſpel, Then,</p>
               <p>For our parts, let us <hi>bleſſe God for his Goſpel.</hi> Let us for ever <hi>honour and reſpect the meſſage of the Goſpel,</hi> yea, let us heartily embrace the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>power of the Goſpel: Let the feet of them which bring the glad tydings of ſalvation, be acceptable unto us,</hi> for as much as <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> are all of them annexed unto the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>2. Then hence it will follow, that <hi>a meer hearing of Chriſt and his doctrine will not ſave,</hi> if <hi>beleeving</hi> be the <hi>only way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are divers ſorts of hearing.</p>
               <p>One with <hi>incogitancy,</hi> when perhaps the <hi>Ear is open,</hi> but the <note place="margin">Three ſorts of hearing.</note> 
                  <hi>minde is aſleep,</hi> and heeds not that precious object reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Another with <hi>Reluctancy,</hi> when the <hi>eare is open,</hi> and the <hi>mind attentive,</hi> but the <hi>heart striving againſt the truth and goodneſſe of the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another with <hi>Conformity:</hi> when the <hi>ear heares,</hi> and the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115662:38"/> 
                  <hi>underſtanding yields,</hi> and the <hi>heart embraceth.</hi> Now it is this latter kinde of hearing, which brings to ſalvation. That <hi>hearing</hi> which conſiſts only in the delivery of the meſſage, which brings <hi>ſomething from God to us,</hi> this will not ſave; but ſuch an <hi>hearing</hi> as <hi>brings back ſomething from us to God,</hi> which is accompanied with <hi>beleeving,</hi> which turnes home the ſoul to the <hi>acceptance</hi> and <hi>embracing of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> this is the only hearing to ſave our ſoules. A motion made and tendred doth not conclude a match, but a motion conſented unto and embraced.</p>
               <p>3. If beleeving in Jeſus Chriſt be the only way of life, then <hi>Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be the main ſcope and mark of all our preaching and ſtudying,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. <hi>I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> It was the maine theame and ſubject upon which that <hi>bleſſed Apoſtle</hi> did ſpend himſelf: Look as it is with a Phyſician, that though he doth ſometimes lance, and ſometimes make very ſick, and ſometimes reſtraine to ſtrictneſſe of diet, and ſometime binde and trouble the patient, and ſometimes relieve him with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious cordials; though theſe actions are different among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet they do concenter in one end, which is health and life. So whether Miniſters preach the knowledge of ſinne, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſtrive to make men ſenſible of ſinne, or whether they let flie the arrows of Gods threatnings upon the conſcience of ſinners, or whether they touch on the mercy Seat; all the end and ſcope is, or ſhould be, <hi>to bring men to Chriſt,</hi> to make Chriſt more glorious in the eyes of ſinners, and to incline their hearts to accept and embrace him.</p>
               <p>Chriſt may be preached two ways.</p>
               <p>Either <hi>Explicitly,</hi> when he in his perſon, or offices, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, <note place="margin">Chriſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two wayes.</note> is the only matter which is handled and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Or <hi>Virtually,</hi> when he is the end of that matter, which is delivered. One of theſe wayes, Chriſt ſtill to be preached; Do I meet with a broken and afflicted ſpirit, groaning under the load of ſinful Nature and life, panting after the Prince of life and peace, willing to yield up it ſelf to all the conditions of God in Chriſt? Here now I am to lift up Chriſt on his Croſſe to ſpread his armes, to ſhew unto that broken Spirit, the very heart blood of Jeſus Chriſt poured out for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115662:39"/> of ſinnes, to be a propitiatory Sacrifice for his ſoule. Do I meet with an obſtinate and proud ſpirit, which dares to <hi>defie juſtice,</hi> and <hi>preſumtuouſly</hi> to <hi>areign mercy.</hi> Here I open the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God againſt ſinne, of purpoſe to awaken the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to caſt down the high and lofty imaginations, and for no other end but this, That ſuch a perſon being now come to the ſenſe of his miſery, may fitly be directed, and ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably encouraged to the ſight and fruition of his remedy in Chriſt.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>FOr the word <hi>(juſtification)</hi> it hath a double acception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Writers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One <hi>Intrinſical,</hi> and ſo it ſignifies to <hi>make a man juſt by an act of infuſion</hi> (that is) by the implantation of ſanctified or holy qualities.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another <hi>Forinſecal,</hi> and ſo it ſignifies to <hi>repute</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a man juſt</hi> by an <hi>act of juriſdiction,</hi> (that is) a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary ſentence to pronounce him righteous, and free from gilt and condemnation.</p>
                  <p>And thus is it (for ought I can learn) altogether uſed and ſenſed in the Scriptures, which ſpeak of our juſtification before God <hi>(viz.)</hi> for ſuch an action of God, whereby after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>of a Judge</hi> he abſolveth and acquitteth an accuſed perſon. Rom. 8. 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that justifieth,</hi> verſe 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth?</hi> where you have a manifeſt Antitheſis, or oppoſition 'twixt <hi>juſtification</hi> and <hi>condemnation;</hi> now as <hi>condemnation</hi> is an action of the Judge, a ſentence of his pronouncing the perſon gilty and obnoxious, ſo <hi>juſtification</hi> (being contrary to it) muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port an action or ſentence acquitting and abſolving. Yea, and again, as <hi>condemnation</hi> moſt improperly and abuſively muſt be interpreted, if we expound it to be a making of a man ſo, and ſo ſinful by infuſion; ſo is juſtification unrightly conceited, when men make it to be a making of a perſon juſt by infuſion of holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerved, that in this kinde of juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> which is <hi>judicial.</hi> There are foure perſons as it were,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>Agent.</hi> One who begins the ſuit, accuſeth, layeth ſuch and ſuch things to the charge of another, the Apoſtle ſaid it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Patient,</hi> the perſon accuſed and charged with default, and offence, and gilt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Advocate,</hi> who endeavours to vindicate the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo charged, from the accuſation, either by declaring the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the perſon, or impleading ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Judge,</hi> who in juſtification of that perſon;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115662:40"/> gives ſentence for the perſon accuſed, according to the valid plea of the Advocate, and ſo abſolveth him. It is thus in the point of our juſtification; there is Satan accuſing, and ſomething elſe. There is <hi>man</hi> accuſed of ſinne and gilt; there is Chriſt interpoſing and pleading <hi>as an advocate,</hi> by his blood and righteouſneſſe; and there is <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>Judge</hi> for <hi>Chriſts ſake acquitting,</hi> and <hi>abſolving</hi> and pronouncing righteous, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting to everlaſting life. So then the proper and punctual acception of the word <hi>juſtification,</hi> is not according to <hi>infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but according to <hi>abſolution</hi> and <hi>pronunciation:</hi> It is not <hi>Phyſical,</hi> as when a man is made whole, but it is <hi>judicial,</hi> as when a man is cleared at the bar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the juſt, they are both an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Proverbs 17. 15. There is the word againe. Not I truſt to be expounded by way of <hi>infuſion</hi> (that is) he who makes a wicked man a good man, by impreſſion of righteouſneſſe, is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, but it is to be expounded by way of judiciary ſentence (that is) he who pronounceth of a wicked man in the Court of Juſtice, as if he were juſt, and reputes him as ſo, and accepts him as ſo; This man is an abomination to the Lord. Now, take one diſtinction, and then I will to the nature of Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold Juſtification. <note place="margin">A twofold Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>One <hi>of the cauſe,</hi> and this is a particular kinde of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance, touching ſuch and ſuch things which are laid to a perſon, perhaps ſometimes very unjuſtly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another <hi>of the perſon,</hi> when he is throughly purged and abſolved; now in this reſpect we ſpeak of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I think for the nature of it may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Juſtification</hi> (immediately) <hi>belongs to God,</hi> it is his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>It is God that juſtifieth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 8. 33. And <hi>who can forgive ſins but God only?</hi> Luk. 5. 21. We well diſtinguiſh 'twixt <hi>officia</hi> and <hi>beneficia,</hi> 'twixt <hi>duties</hi> and 'twixt <hi>bleſſings: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> belong to us, but <hi>bleſſings</hi> belong to God: It is God who is offended, and therefore condemnation and abſolution belong to him, to the Judge, not to any other; hence ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>not imputing their ſin.</hi> You do well to diſtinguiſh of the cauſes of our Juſtification. There is firſt <hi>the prime cauſe,</hi> the Author, and this is <hi>God the Father,</hi> who <hi>gave his</hi> only begotten Son for us, and ſet him forth to be a propitiation for ſinne, through faith in his blood, that all who do believe in him ſhould be juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. And who is the Judge abſolving all that believe, and pronouncing them juſt in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The meritorious cauſe,</hi> ſo the <hi>Son of God our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> is ſaid to juſtifie us, both as our <hi>ſurety,</hi> in paying our debt, and laying down the full price of our redemption, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. 11. thereby affording unto us the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and as our <hi>Interceſſor</hi> and <hi>Advocate,</hi> pleading effectually for us, that his merits may be imputed to us. Hence is it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. 11. <hi>My righteous ſervant ſhall juſtifie many. God the Father</hi> juſtifies as a <hi>Judge</hi> by way of prime authority, and <hi>God the Son juſtifies as a Mediator.</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> juſtifies as a <hi>ſurety,</hi> paying our debt and giving ſatisfaction to the Father for us to the utmoſt, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtifieth us, as a <hi>Creditor,</hi> fully accepting of that price and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The applying cauſe,</hi> and thus the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> may be ſaid to juſtifie, in aſmuch as he conjoynes Chriſt and the ſoul (by faith,) together, whence ariſeth a participation of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and the pardon of ſin by him. Once more diſtinguiſh of juſtification, it may be taken two wayes, either <hi>actively,</hi> as a judiciary ſentence abſolving, acquitting &amp;c. and ſo we ſay <hi>God juſtifieth;</hi> Or <hi>Paſſively,</hi> as a thing apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and reſted on, and ſo we ſay that <hi>Faith juſtifieth;</hi> not as if faith did acquit, but as it takes and receiveth the acquittance;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115662:41"/> not as if faith did impute a righteouſneſſe, but becauſe it receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and reſteth on the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, by God imputed to us: now when we ſay that juſtification is an Action of God, it is meet for you to underſtand ſomewhat of the kinde of this action. For the actions of God are of different ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Some, which are <hi>produced within us,</hi> and make a reall altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">2. Sorts of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and change in the ſoul of man; thus <hi>ſanctification</hi> is an <hi>action of God,</hi> (that is) ſuch an action of God as is altering the inward frame, and qualities of the ſoul, of unholy, making them holy, of unbelieving making them believing, of hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſoft, of earthly making them heavenly, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Others are <hi>wrought for us, but not in us,</hi> and though they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a change of the condition, and ſtate of the perſon, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and formally, they imprint no change in the inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; And thus <hi>Justification is an action of God,</hi> not an <hi>action changing the inward frame of the heart,</hi> but an <hi>action changing the great eſtimation of the perſon;</hi> as when one of a bond-man is made free; this alters the ſtate, but not the nature of the perſon: when a gilty perſon is pardoned by his Prince, this alters not his nature, but it doth alter his condition; he is now in the ſtate <hi>of life,</hi> who before was in the ſtate <hi>of death.</hi> So is it in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, it is ſuch an action, which alters the ſtate, (that is) the man who is in the ſtate of wrath and condemnation, being juſtified, is now acquitted, and ſo paſſed into the ſtate of life and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>A man who before was guilty of ſin and damnation, the ſame man (remaining a ſinner in himſelf, and in himſelf worthy of damnation) is in his juſtification abſolved from the gilt of ſin, and accepted as righteous in Chriſt, and is paſſed into the ſtate of ſalvation. We deny not but the <hi>blood</hi> and the <hi>water</hi> goes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; (that is) whom God juſtifieth by the blood of Chriſt, him alſo he ſanctifieth, and waſheth by the Spirit of Chriſt; but the action of the blood is one thing, and the action of the water is another thing. The light and heat in the fire go together, yet the action of light is not the action of heat: So here, <hi>The action of the blood is a juſtifying action,</hi> and this is <hi>without us,</hi> yet <hi>for us,</hi> and <hi>of us; The action of the water</hi> is a <hi>ſanctifying action,</hi> and this is <hi>for us and in us too.</hi>

                     <hi>THe perſon juſtified is a believing ſinner:</hi> the Apoſtle is clear. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>To him that believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe.</hi> There is great diſpute which is firſt, of Faith or Juſtification; to me now it ſeemes a fruitleſſe trouble to moleſt our ſelves with priorities in this kinde, I conceive we may diſtinguiſh 'twixt the <hi>purchaſe of our Justification,</hi> which was long ago in the <hi>blood of Chriſt.</hi> He was a <hi>Lamb ſlaine long ſince for to merit the remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> neither doth he now begin his <hi>merit,</hi> who hath heretofore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'twixt the <hi>imputation of that purchaſe.</hi> It is true, whiles I am an unbelieving perſon, my juſtification is already as a purchaſe, but untill I believe, <hi>God imputes it not unto me.</hi> My meaning is this, there is a <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved pardon of ſinne <hi>before ever I believe,</hi> nay, be <hi>before ever I was borne,</hi> but <hi>God imputes this over to me when I believe,</hi> as ſoon as ever I take <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>faith, God imputes the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt unto me,</hi> and will <hi>not impute my ſinnes to me:</hi> And Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is open enough for this, we reading ſo conſtantly in the New-Teſtament for men to come in and believe that <hi>they may have remiſſion of ſinnes in the blood of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>through him alſo eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I only propound this ſcruple, whether <hi>faith</hi> be to deale with the <hi>perſon of Chriſt firſt,</hi> or with his <hi>benefits firſt;</hi> Surely we ſay with his perſon, and then with his portion; well then, if faith deales with the perſon of Chriſt immediately, then it appears that a man muſt believe, and ſo be juſtified, foraſmuch as <hi>juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an action of God imputing the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and not imputing ſin,</hi> which are the generall benefits (as I may ſo ſpeak) of Chriſt. It is not handſome to conceive that God ſhould firſt pardon me, and then I believe, or that I ſhould have the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt before I have Chriſt himſelf, which muſt be, if there be a priority of juſtification before faith. For my part I conjecture that they are Semultaneous things (that is)
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115662:42"/> they go both together. If yet any men will be acute, let them be ſo: The perill is little on either ſide, ſo that I have faith, and then am juſtified; or ſo that I am juſtified, and then have faith, or ſo that I have faith to be juſtified, will in the ſubſtance and event, redound all to one.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>quid,</hi> what this remiſſion is; I anſwer, <hi>it is an exempting of the ſinner from guilt redounding to puniſhment:</hi> If any man ſin, <hi>guilt</hi> cleaves univerſally to the ſin, but then in <hi>Justification</hi> it ſhall <hi>not be imputed,</hi> it ſhall be taken away in reſpect of efficacy and redundancy. Suppoſe a perſon areigned, and caſt for a murder, and the King graciouſly ſteps in and pardons him; though this pardon makes not the murder formally to be no murder, and though it makes not the murder now meritoriouſly deadly, yet it doth hold off the efficacy of that gilt, that now it ſhall not prove death to this perſon, becauſe he pardons him. So in <hi>Juſtification,</hi> where God pardons the ſinner, he doth not make ſinne to be no ſinne, or that there ſhould not be any <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condemnability</hi> in ſinne, but that it ſhall not <hi>effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:115662:42"/> to the death and damnation and hell of the perſon, whom he hath acquitted for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>quouſque?</hi> How farre remiſſion of ſinnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in Juſtification. There is a twofold remiſſion. <note place="margin">A twofold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</note>

                  <p>One <hi>particular,</hi> which is circumſcribed to ſome particular facts, and is ordinary in the Courts of humane Princes, who limit and reſtreine their diſcharges of offenders.</p>
                  <p>Another <hi>univerſall,</hi> which reacheth to the whole eſtate of gilt; now this I take as ſure, that whomſoever <hi>God juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,</hi> he will <hi>forgive unto him all his ſinnes.</hi> All his ſinnes <note place="margin">

                  <p>It is true, I confeſſe, and embrace that opinion, that <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> is not <hi>a divided act,</hi> it is not repeated over and over and over, but it is one act only, but whither it be <hi>one tranſient act,</hi> (as if all were daſhed out with a pen) or whither it be <hi>one continued act,</hi> is very diſputable. The Scripture leanes much to this latter, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes God to be <hi>a God forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſinnes,</hi> importing a courſe of pardoning, and not a momentany act.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it is hard to utter how God doth forgive a ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath ſinned, which muſt be if pardon for all ſins be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany act.</p>
                  <p>Yet I had rather captivate my judgment, then occaſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; only remember two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, no doubt but the <hi>juſtified perſon ſhall have every ſin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned;</hi> not ſome only, but all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>juſtification doth not admit degrees:</hi> though it may a <hi>continuance:</hi> The <hi>righteouſneſſe and merit of Chriſt</hi> which is our juſtification, is not more or leſſe, but is at all times one and moſt perfect.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, no other righteouſneſſe can juſtifie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>as Chriſt was made ſinne for us,</hi> ſo we are <hi>made righteouſneſſe by him,</hi> viz. only by imputation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> call upon us for a righteouſneſſe in Juſtification, they will bring one forth of their hearts and good works, <hi>Menſtruous cloths,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, but we produce a <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe moſt full, perfect,</hi> every way exact, not <hi>in us,</hi> but <hi>in Christ,</hi> yet <hi>imputed to us by God.</hi>

                  <p>For he is to be termed a <hi>Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> not who doth <hi>receive,</hi> and <hi>take</hi> the redemption and ſalvation procured by another, but who <hi>brings redemption</hi> and <hi>ſalvation;</hi> we are by the Redemption of Chriſt truly ſaid to be redeemed, though not our Redeemers, and ſo by the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, are we truly accounted righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Againe, if the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt</hi> be ſo imputed to us in juſtification, that for it <hi>we are accounted perfectly righteous,</hi> as if it were our own moſt perfect and intrinſecal; Then why may not we be accounted <hi>as righteous as Chriſt?</hi> yea and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſts righteouſneſſe, why may we not be the <hi>Saviours of men?</hi> Since that is the righteouſneſſe which doth ſave all that are ſaved.</p>

                  <p>To compare the ſame righteouſneſſe with the ſame, is illogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and groſſe, for it is one and the ſame righteouſneſſe which is <hi>inherent in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>imputed</hi> to the beleeving ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is not imputed to any particular beleever according to the whole <hi>latitude of its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,</hi> but according to the <hi>particular exigence of the perſon;</hi> It is not imputed to <hi>Paul</hi> as the general price of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all, but as the price by which his ſoul in particular is redeemed.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord be the only way to be ſaved, Then it doth much concerne us to ſearch our ſelves, whether we do <hi>beleeve indeed in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three things which I will <hi>premiſe</hi> as ſo many grounds, why we ſhould put our ſelves upon this enquiry, and then I will give unto you the diſcoveries themſelves. The premiſes are theſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the difficulty of beleeving in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the facility of errour, and miſtake about belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the bitter danger and ſure miſery of not beleeving in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The difficulty of beleeving is increaſed by the ſingularity of ſo <hi>ſtrange and wonderful a goodneſſe.</hi> It is ſo great and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralell'd, that a man can hardly believe it to be true. To have an <hi>eſtate in Chriſt,</hi> in God, freely, all at once; How can this be? <hi>The depth of gilt.</hi> I am an enemy, God is Juſt; I have runne into ſuch high forfeitures, ſo unneceſſarily loſt my ſelf, provoked God ſo often, and the threatnings are planted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinners, there is no hope, no probability, (if a ſmall debt, &amp;c,</p>
               <p>But for the difficulty of it, that it is not ſo eaſie a thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt Jeſus, this ſhall appeare in divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is no <hi>natural principle of juſtifying faith now in man.</hi> An act, or motion, or quality, which hath a riſe and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115662:45"/> bottom within the ſubject, may ſpring forth with ſome eaſe: a ſtone having a natural propenſion and <hi>impetus</hi> to deſcend, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> if you do but quit the hand of it, it will down; but now to make a mighty ſtone to mount the hill, to get up into the air, there being no natural aptneſſe to this, it is a hard and difficult attempt.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that a man hath an <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> but the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>Myſtery of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is a riddle to the natural underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> the <hi>faculties</hi> naturally conſidered, have no elevation to this object, unleſſe the <hi>Lord by his Almighty power</hi> begets and works faith in the ſoul. The ſoule thinks not on him, neither can it draw it ſelf to him. Like the needle, untill it be <note place="margin">Simile.</note> touched, it will not ſtart up towards the pole; ſo unleſſe the <hi>Lord</hi> doth touch our hearts by his bleſſed Spirit, we ſhall never cloſe with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So then, this is one thing to ſhew the difficulty of beleeving, the habit of it is out of our power, out of our ſphear; it cannot be produced by any <hi>ſtrength of nature,</hi> but by the <hi>ſole Arme of God.</hi> Hence that of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53 1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom is the Arme of the Lord revealed? who hath beleeved our report?</hi> The teſtimony of the Goſpel concerning Chriſt will not be beleeved, unleſſe the Lord doth reveale his own Arme, (that is) until he doth put forth his own Almighty ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>natural principle of infidelity and unbelief in every mans heart.</hi> If the paper were faire, if there were no precedent blurs and blots, then it were not ſo hard to imprint ſome legible Characters; Or if the wax were ſoft, and the iron heated, now it were eaſie to engrave what kinde of armes the Artifier pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; But when the wax and the iron are hard and cold, now the impreſſion is difficult, becauſe the reſiſtance is ſtrong; if there were in our hearts any <hi>obediential principles,</hi> which could before hand temper the minde, and frame the will, then when God offers Chriſt, little a do would ſerve the turne; But our hearts naturally bend the other way; there is in us a natural unapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nay, an enmity to beleeve. <hi>Enmity</hi> to the habit and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of faith, <hi>blindneſſe, errour, pride, ſtubbornneſſe, diſobedience</hi> in our hearts. We have ſuch ſlow and untoward hearts, ſo armed with all ſorts of corrupt reaſonings, ſo conſulting with ſenſe and rational evidences, ſo ready on every inevidence,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115662:45"/> to miſtruſt, doubt, queſtion, gainſay, that all Arguments will not perſwade us that God will give us Chriſt, and pardon our ſinnes. You know that when the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally on earth, and did <hi>preach</hi> himſelf, and in that manner, that <hi>none ſpake with that Authority</hi> as he, and confirmed the truth of his Divinity, and Mediatorſhip by <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> yet very few beleeved, (hiſtorically) that <hi>he was the Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>he was the Sonne of God.</hi> Take me now a perſon, who is ſenſible of his ſinful guilts; Tell him of the need he hath of a Saviour, he will grant it, repreſent unto him the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, the excellency, the tenderneſſe of the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> that he is the <hi>Mediator,</hi> the <hi>Propitiation for ſinnes,</hi> that <hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes is in his blood,</hi> both <hi>intenſively,</hi> for the great degrees and aggravations of ſinne, and <hi>extenſively,</hi> for the ſeveral kindes of ſinne. Tell him, that the <hi>Lord Jeſus came to ſeek ſuch a loſt perſon</hi> as he, that he came to <hi>looſe ſuch a captive</hi> as he, that he came to <hi>binde up ſuch a broken ſpirit</hi> as he is, that he came <hi>to eaſe and refreſh</hi> ſuch a <hi>burdened and laden ſoul;</hi> Yea, and anſwer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection after objection, doubt after doubt, fear after fear, that the perſon cannot put by the arguments why he ſhould beleeve, nor urge and reinforce his reaſons, why he ſhould hold off from cloſing with Chriſt, and putting his ſoule on him, yet this we finde, he cannot (when all is ſaid) he cannot beleeve. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> doth throw up ſo many miſts, and ſo many feares, and is (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times) ſo unreaſonable, that yet it will hold off the heart. Neither the <hi>goodneſſe of God,</hi> nor the <hi>truths of God,</hi> nor the <hi>mercies of God,</hi> nor the <hi>freeneſs of them,</hi> nor the <hi>perſon of Christ,</hi> nor the <hi>merits of Chriſt,</hi> nor the <hi>tenderneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> nor the <hi>gracious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> invitation, command, threatning of Chriſt, will make the heart to come in unto him.</p>

               <p>Firſt, to <hi>his Perſon,</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is an <hi>holy Perſon,</hi> and <note place="margin">A fourfold op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> none can take him in truth, but muſt take him ſo, to <hi>be holy as he is holy.</hi> He is the holy one of God, and he is called the <hi>holy Child Jeſus,</hi> and an <hi>holy, undefiled high Prieſt, ſeparated from ſinners.</hi> Now the heart (naturally) is in love with ſinne, and Chriſt tells us that this very thing is a cauſe why men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not: See <hi>John</hi> 3. 19. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light</hi>

                  <hi>is come into the world, and men loved darkneſſe rather then light.</hi> Chriſt comes thus to a man, I am he who will ſave thy ſoule if thou wilt take me, but then know, that I am an <hi>holy perſon;</hi> if thou wilt have me thou muſt let go thy ſinnes; Now this breaks off the match, hinders the bargain, this goes to the heart: A man naturally will as ſoon part with his life, as with the ſin of his love.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>to his condition:</hi> There is a double condition of <note place="margin">A double ſtate of Chriſt.</note> Chriſt, one is <hi>Triumphant,</hi> another is <hi>Militant; Gloria in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſis,</hi> that is, the triumphant condition, <hi>Tubulationes in Terris,</hi> that is the militant condition; the <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> that is the triumphant condition; the <hi>Crown of Thornes,</hi> that is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant condition.</p>
               <p>Now the heart naturally is unſuffering: It is a terrour to it to ſpeak of afflictions, ſorrowes, reproaches, loſſes; We are willing to enjoy the world, to taſte of pleaſures, to handle profits, to reſt in eaſe, to walk at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to rejoyce with our Friends, to be ſpread abroad with high eſtimations. The <hi>young man,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> bade him <hi>ſell all that he had, and give it to the poore,</hi> (It was <hi>praeceptum experimentale) he goes away ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to the <hi>Scepter and Government of Christ;</hi> we <hi>will not have this man Reigne over us,</hi> ſay they; and you reade in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2. How they did <hi>conſult to break his bands aſunder.</hi> The <hi>Scepter of Chriſt</hi> is Heavenly, and his <hi>Lawes</hi> are ſpiritual, and his <hi>Wayes</hi> are righteous and ſtraight, they lay injunctions on the inward man, as well as on the outward converſation, and binde the thoughts, and the intentions and affections. Now what do you meane, to pinne up a ſpirit which would have elbow roome? what, would you have a <hi>licentious heart,</hi> and a <hi>turning and winding conſcience,</hi> to be preciſed, and narrowed, and reſtrained, and ſo every way ſtraitened? You muſt give it leave to break the Sabbath, to improve its gaines diſhoneſtly, to ſweare now and then, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to the <hi>Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> O what a do had that <hi>bleſſed Apoſtle</hi> with the <hi>Romanes,</hi> with the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:115662:46"/> with others, to break them off from <hi>Iuſtification by Works;</hi> And to faſten upon their hearts the Juſtification by Faith.</p>
               <p>We are apt to ſtand upon our ſelves, and to look for the matter of our acceptance and acquittance in our ſelves on man; he thinks that his <hi>good meaning</hi> ſhall make him ſpeed; Another thinks that his <hi>doing no body any harme</hi> will let him into Heaven, or elſe God help us; Another ſtands on his <hi>devout Sacrifices;</hi> Another on his <hi>charitable bounties;</hi> Yea, and thoſe who ſhould know better in the Doctrine of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, how extreamly do they cling to their <hi>inherent Graces?</hi> much a do, before they can be made to <hi>caſt their Crowns to the earth, and to give the glory only to Chriſt who is worthy.</hi> What paines is God forced to take to break us off from our ſelves? we are ſo proud, and ſo unwilling to be beholding to Gods free grace, and Chriſt, that God is faine to break our heart to pieces, and to ſplit our ſhip into ſhivers, that we might only to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He muſt imprint the holy and mighty vigour of the Law on our conſciences, to ſhew us our utter impotency, and ſenſibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with our marvellous imperfections in graces, and interruptions in duties, and excurſions of daily ſinnings, and all to fetch us entirely, to caſt our ſafeties only on the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Jeſus Chriſt</p>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt there are <hi>divers kindes of faith:</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpake of bodies, <hi>all bodies are not the ſame bodies,</hi> but there are bodies <hi>Coeleſtial,</hi> and bodies <hi>Terrestial;</hi> ſo I ſay of <hi>Faith,</hi> all faith, (I ſpeak of habitual faith) is not the ſame kinde of faith, we read of a <hi>Faith</hi> which the <hi>Devils have,</hi> and we read of a <hi>Faith</hi> which the <hi>Hypocrites have,</hi> and we read of a <hi>Faith</hi> which even <hi>Chriſts enemies</hi> (whom he did not dare to truſt) had, and we read of a <hi>Precious Faith,</hi> a <hi>Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> a <hi>juſtifying and ſaving faith.</hi> Divines ordinarily diſtinguiſh of faith;</p>
               <p>There is an <hi>Hiſtorical faith,</hi> which is a <hi>crediting</hi> the word <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating,</hi> but not an <hi>embracing</hi> of it <hi>promiſing;</hi> it is like the paſſing through a Garden, and obſerving and ſmelling, but not a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is gathered, ſo in <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> the eye of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goes over the Word of God, and hath ſome apprehenſions, and general grants, and intellectual ſubmiſſions, that God doth not lye, but what he ſaith is true. Nevertheleſſe, there is not that quality of juſtifying faith in this which makes the heart to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115662:47"/> cloſe with the goodneſſe of truth, and to embrace Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. There is a <hi>wonderful faith,</hi> a <hi>faith of miracles;</hi> to remove mountaines, to raiſe the dead, which had ſome ſpecial and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate promiſe, and yet it was a gift beſtowed on thoſe who had no faith to ſave themſelves: Many who have <hi>caſt out devils,</hi> may at the <hi>laſt day be caſt among the devils:</hi> Lord, Lord, have not we <hi>Propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Devils?</hi> And yet Chriſt bid them depart, <hi>Non novi vos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. There is a <hi>temporary faith:</hi> which hath in it ſome great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the truths of God; yea, and reverent aſſents; yea, and ſome delightfull contentations in the ſame; yea, and ſome fruitfull expreſſions, and with all theſe, a ſingular degree of profeſſion, even to a zealous forwardneſſe, and notoriouſneſs, ſo that a man may be in the eye of others like a tall Ship, and yet there is a Leake in the bottome, which on the ſudden ſinks all.</p>
               <p>This <hi>temporary faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> though in many reſpects it handles the ſame object with ſaving faith, it is tampering much about Chriſt, and the promiſes, yet it is intrinſically, and extreamly different from it.</p>
               <p>It doth not differ from it in reſpect of <hi>eminency or degrees,</hi> nor in reſpect of <hi>exiſtence</hi> or duration onely, (for the one is a living Spring, and the other is a decaying Flood,) but in reſpect of <hi>formal nature</hi> alſo: The <hi>temporary faith</hi> doth not indeed bring all the heart and ſettle it on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>4. There is this <hi>juſtifying and ſaving faith,</hi> which beſtowes the whole heart on Chriſt, and takes Chriſt unfeignedly to be Lord and Saviour. Now where there are ſo many ſorts, it is not a great difficulty, nor an impoſſibility to miſtake, <hi>error is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,</hi> (ſaid the Phyloſopher) but the <hi>tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nay, ſecondly, there is <hi>a great conſimilitude of one of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames of faith, with faith it ſelf;</hi> viz. <hi>credulity.</hi> It is ſtrange (yet ordinary) that a man ſhould make a heaven of his own, and a God of his own, and a Chriſt of his own, and a faith of his own, and a way to heaven of his own. <hi>Preſumption</hi> is a work
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115662:48"/> much of an <hi>idle fancy,</hi> and a <hi>graceleſſe heart,</hi> like a <hi>thiefe,</hi> very apt to finger the Kings coine, but without a warrant. But to the thing: Is there <hi>knowledge in faith?</hi> why, <hi>preſumption pretends to that:</hi> is there <hi>confidence in faith?</hi> what more bold then <hi>preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> is there any <hi>ſweet aſſurance in faith?</hi> why, <hi>preſumption never doubted,</hi> but could believe ever ſince a man was borne: is there any <hi>joy in faith?</hi> why, <hi>preſump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to have a minde taught of God, and to have an underſtanding bowed with the ſtrength of Divine light, and inward change to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of truth, and to have a will ſweetly renewed, and with an holy trembling, humbly receiving Chriſt in his perſon, and offices, and beſtowing the whole ſoul and body on him againe; here the work ſticks.</p>

                  <p>A man cannot <hi>beleeve in Chriſt,</hi> he cannot receive <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with all his heart, he hath ſome <hi>hiſtorical</hi> evidence of Chriſt, he muſt have ſome <hi>knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> what he is, and what he hath done, or elſe he cannot take him to be his Lord and Saviour; Yet <hi>this knowledge</hi> doth not infallibly conclude <hi>justifying and ſaving faith;</hi> for as much as the <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi> may ſee much of Chriſt, they may have a high degree of intellectual apprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>Again, a man cannot by <hi>faith take Chriſt</hi> to be his Lord and Saviour, unleſſe he hath ſome <hi>ſenſibleneſſe</hi> of his ſinful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; our heart will not look towards Chriſt, it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his excellencies, nor of his own neceſſity, until we feel our ſinfulneſſe, and loſtneſſe, and vileneſſe; The <hi>whole</hi> neither <hi>need,</hi> nor <hi>look for a Phyſician,</hi> yet a perſon may be <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his ſinful condition;</hi> he may not only by the light of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience</hi> apprehend ſome broader and ſtirring enormities, but he may by a ſmart and <hi>quick light</hi> let in by the <hi>Miniſtry of the Word,</hi> diſcern heaps of wickedneſſe in his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> for which his conſcience may ſting him with wonderfully bitter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, and yet ſuch a perſon (poſſibly) may not riſe from trouble to faith, as is evident in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> So then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that in the ſearchings and trials for <hi>faith,</hi> you do not conclude the <hi>preſence of the habit</hi> from the <hi>common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent of faith,</hi> for as much as faith is but a contingent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of them, ſometimes it doth follow, ſometimes it doth not. As in <hi>Marriage,</hi> ſometimes it doth follow the motion which is made, and ſometimes it doth not; ſo the <hi>eſpouſing of our ſoules to Chriſt</hi> by faith, ſometimes it doth follow <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> ſometimes it doth not, ſometimes it doth follow the <hi>preaching of the Word,</hi> and yet ſometimes it doth not; for <hi>all have heard, yet who hath beleeved,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. ſometimes it doth follow the <hi>motions,</hi> and <hi>inward excitations of the Spirit,</hi> and ſometimes it doth not.</p>
                  <p>2. There are ſome things which <hi>faith only doth produce,</hi> yet becauſe it doth <hi>not produce them alwayes,</hi> a man therefore muſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115662:51"/> not negatively conclude from the abſence of them, the abſence of faith.</p>
                  <p>You know that <hi>holy and ſpiritual joy,</hi> it is the ſole fruit of faith, therefore faith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Beleeving, ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious.</hi> There is nothing which can preſent to the heart of a Chriſtian, ſuch full cauſe of <hi>joy</hi> as <hi>faith,</hi> ſuch a God, ſuch a Chriſt, ſuch a love, ſuch a blood, ſuch a mercy, ſuch happineſſe, ſuch unmixt, and proper, and ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good. There is a <hi>carnal joy</hi> which ſparkles from the cup of pleaſure, and there is a <hi>gliſtering joy</hi> which the raies of gold may produce, and there is a <hi>beaſtly joy,</hi> which the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of ſinful luſts may ſend forth, and there is a <hi>flaſhing and tranſient joy,</hi> which the pride of hypocrites may dart out, but <hi>ſound,</hi> and <hi>weighty,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual joy,</hi> which is a well grounded, and not to be repented, affecting of the heart, that comes only from faith: Yet it comes from faith as a ſeparable effect; look as trouble and ſorrow is a Contingent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, ſo even <hi>in actu imperato,</hi> true joy is a ſeparable fruit of faith. Though the branches and green leaves do ſprout out of the living root only, yet this color doth not appeare at all times; Though the blade comes only from the graines caſt into the earth, yet you cannot alwayes obſerve the blade. Though the fleſh and natural complexion flows only from health, yet there may be ſad occaſions, which though they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh health, may yet fowle and blubber the complexion. So even the beleeving perſon may ſometimes have a tear in his eye, an handkercheif in his hand, a ſigh in his breaſt, and yet have faith in his heart. He may <hi>ſit down in aſhes,</hi> and <hi>feed on tears,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, and for all this he may be a true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: He is not alwayes able to ſee the cauſes of his joy, nor to break through the contrarieties to his faith, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the quaſhings of his comforts. Therefore when you are to <hi>try</hi> your ſelves about your <hi>faith,</hi> do not make a <hi>negative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> from <hi>ſeparable evidences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. There are ſome things which <hi>faith only doth produce,</hi> not as <hi>eſſential properties,</hi> but as <hi>magnificent testimonies.</hi>

                  <p>The moral Phyloſophers diſtinguiſh 'twixt the <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>liberality,</hi> as it is abſolutely conſidered, and as it is <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently</hi> conſidered, being raiſed to <hi>magnificence.</hi> To give a

Though a child cannot bear a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of an hundred pound weight, yet he can deſire the breaſt and ſuck; the bearing of ſuch a burden belongs to ſtrength, and yet the very ſucking ſhews that he hath life. Though a Chriſtian be not able in all reſpects, at all times, with all moderation and ſilence, to paſſe preſently through <hi>every heavy occurrence,</hi> which ſhews <hi>ſtrength of faith,</hi> yet his heart may moſt <hi>affectionately cling about Chriſt</hi> which ſhews the <hi>truth of faith.</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, that no unbeleeving heart can, and doth love Chriſt; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I ſay, if we can prove theſe foure concluſions, then it will be moſt evident and certaine, that the love of Chriſt is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Argument or Teſtimony of a true faith in Chriſt: Thus then,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Love is not ſeparated from faith,</hi> If you peruſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you ſhall finde them go hand in hand. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>For in Jeſus Chriſt neither circumciſſion availeth any thing, nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but faith which works by love,</hi> (that is) Chriſt is not mine, becauſe I am a Jew; nor is he mine, becauſe I am a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile: but he is mine, becauſe I am a <hi>Beleever,</hi> and if my <hi>Faith</hi> in him be true, it will expreſſe it ſelf by <hi>love.</hi> I Theſ. 1. 3. <hi>Your work of faith, and labour of love in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Faith and love</hi> are like a warm hand; <hi>faith</hi> is the hand, and <hi>love</hi> is the warmth in it; <hi>faith</hi> cannot be the hand to take Chriſt, but <hi>love</hi> will be the warmth to heat our affections unto Chriſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith and love which is in Ghriſt Jeſus. Faith</hi> and <hi>love</hi> are like the husband and the wife, and <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love</hi> are like the mother and the daughter; See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 5. And indeed it ſtands with unanſwerable reaſon, that faith and love cannot be divided; for as much as <hi>faith in Chriſt,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, repreſents the abſolute and effectual cauſe of love to Chriſt. It doth ſee ſuch a meaſure of goodneſſe and mercy from God through Chriſt, and ſuch a height, and depth, and breadth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115662:53"/> of love to us in Chriſt, and ſuch an excellency of holy perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and amiableneſſe in Chriſt, which drawes the ſoul with ſtrong affections of love to Chriſt againe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if faith might be without love, then a perſon in Chriſt might be <hi>Anathema-maranatha.</hi> foraſmuch as he <hi>who loves not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is, &amp;c. but it is a monſtrous wickedneſſe to conceive that a beleever in Chriſt ſhould be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is no <hi>believer</hi> in any <hi>degree of faith,</hi> but he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hath a love of Chriſt. The <hi>weak Chriſtian</hi> as well as the <hi>ſtrong,</hi> the <hi>plant</hi> as well as the <hi>cedar.</hi> The <hi>Father of a child</hi> who cryed out, <hi>I believe, help my unbelief;</hi> as well as <hi>Abraham the father of the faithful.</hi> Though one Chriſtian may produce ſome teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which another cannot: though every one cannot ſay with <hi>Paul I am fully perſwaded,</hi> yet every one can ſay with <hi>Peter</hi> when Chriſt demanded of him, <hi>Simon ſon of Jonas, loveſt thou me?</hi>

                  <p>Yea, thirdly, whatſoever <hi>ſtraits the believing ſoul</hi> is caſt into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when it is in death, in flames for Chriſt, yet it can love Chriſt when it is under the crowd of temptations, when it is in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes of deſertion. When the Skirmiſh of reaſonings do prevaile upon the ſoul ſo highly and ſtrongly, that the heart is ready to conclude againſt it ſelf, that God looks not on it, Chriſt will not be mine, yet even then however, <hi>I love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I love him, though I can ſee no ſenſible teſtimony of love from him, my heart is ſtill towards him, he is my Center and Loadſtone.</p>
                  <p>No meerly <hi>unbelieving perſon</hi> can <hi>love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For, what is love? Love (you know) it is the <hi>ſetling and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting of the heart:</hi> It is ſuch an affection as <hi>knits the ſoule to Chriſt,</hi> but it is impoſſible that this ſhould be whiles the heart hath no faith.

                  <p>A Second trial of our true faith in Chriſt Jeſus is this <hi>inward change and ſanctity of the heart,</hi> is an infallible teſtimony of a <hi>living faith.</hi> Divines diſtinguiſh of a <hi>common faith</hi> and of a <hi>ſpecial faith,</hi> and according to their nature ſo are their effects; a <hi>common faith</hi> may elevate the minde to ſingular apprehenſions, notable expreſſions, outward conformities, in matters either not difficult or dangerous. But <hi>ſpecial faith</hi> hath a diſtinguiſhing operation, it works that which no falſe or pretenſive faith can; What's that? This is it, it doth change the heart, and is ever a companion with inward holineſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:115662:54"/>
                  <p> There be three things which I will ſhew you about <note place="margin">3. Things.</note> this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>that true faith doth produce a change,</hi> there is a twofold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> change, 1. One of the <hi>condition,</hi> which is, when a man once in the ſtate of <hi>death,</hi> is now paſſed over to the ſtate of <hi>life,</hi> once in the termes of <hi>condemnation,</hi> is now tranſlated to the ſtate of <hi>abſolution,</hi> and this change faith findes for us in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, the imputation of whoſe righteouſneſſe in juſtification</hi> changeth the ſtate, ſo that our guilty debts are taken off, and we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled:</p>
                  <p>Secondly, which is of the perſon, and this change is the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mans nature, for <hi>faith</hi> is not only a <hi>juſtifying grace,</hi> but it is alſo <hi>a ſanctifying grace:</hi> Hence theſe phraſes, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>purifying their hearts by faith,</hi> Acts 26. 18. <hi>that they may receive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes and inheritance among them which are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith that is in Christ.</hi> As the <hi>blood of Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>pure blood</hi> as well as a <hi>precious blood,</hi> and as it is a <hi>clenſing blood,</hi> as well as an <hi>expiating blood;</hi> ſo <hi>faith</hi> is a grace, not only to <hi>acquit,</hi> but alſo to <hi>purge</hi> and renew; It is not onely an <hi>entitleing grace,</hi> (that is) that grace which doth intereſt us into Chriſt and his benefits, but it is alſo a <hi>conforming grace,</hi> (that is) ſuch a grace as works into us the vertues and holy qualities of Chriſt. And therefore you read that it doth <hi>engraffe us into the ſimilitude of his death,</hi> Ro. 8. and into the <hi>fellowſhip of his ſufferings and reſurrection,</hi> Phil. 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>that every believer hath a changed and a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt</hi> (and you know that it is faith which unites to Chriſt, and plants us into him,) <hi>he is a new creature,</hi> (that is) that a man is altered in his inward frame, in his faculties, in his inclinations, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>There is a change, either in the ceſſation of ſome particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which an unbeliever may attaine; and there is a change in the <hi>newneſſe of nature</hi> when the ſoul is turned, and biaſſed, and enclined quite another way. I confeſſe, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>if any man be in Chriſt he is a ſtrong creature,</hi> yet he ſaith he is a <hi>new creature,</hi> for though every believer hath not that matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ripeneſſe, and ſtrength, yet he hath a <hi>newneſſe</hi> in his nature, an holy change wrought in him throughout. Look as
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115662:55"/> the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> derived guilt and corruption to his poſterity; ſo the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> derives pardon and holineſſe, therefore he is called a <hi>quickning ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. It is not 'twixt Chriſt and believers, as 'twixt a root and a dead limb, which hangs on, but hath no life, nor ſap: Chriſt hath really no ſuch members in his body, he is not like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars image,</hi> whoſe <hi>head is of gold,</hi> and the <hi>feet of clay;</hi> for a man to boaſt much of his head, of Chriſt, of gold, and yet he to remaine a piece of clay; he to have a nature utterly heterogeneous unto Chriſt, this man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf. For every plant, every graff that is inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt hath the aliquality of his nature. Hence thoſe who in <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. are ſtiled <hi>Beleevers,</hi> they are ſaid in the next <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>to be borne of the Will of God;</hi> Now as in the natural birth there is a new forme, ſo in the heavenly there is a ſupernatural and holy frame of grace ingenerated.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>No man hath a changed nature but a Beleever.</hi> Why? Becauſe no man hath <hi>grace</hi> but from <hi>Christ,</hi> and none have <hi>Chriſt</hi> but <hi>Beleevers:</hi> Again, it is impoſſible for a man to be lovely in the eyes of God without faith, but if any man might have a changed and ſanctified heart, and yet want faith, then one might be lovely in Gods eyes wanting faith, for as much as God loves and delights in an holy heart. So then this is moſt evident, that if faith goes not without a change, and if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Beleever hath a change, and no unbeleever hath it, I ſay this will follow, Therefore if a man can finde a change of his heart, he then hath the truth of faith.</p>
                  <p>Now then enquire; is there vertue gone from Chriſt to make thy dark minde ſeeing, thy ſtubborn judgement yeilding and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing thy proud heart, humbling thy filthy heart, cleanſing thy hard hard, relenting and mourning, thy carnal affections to be heavenly, thy ſinful ſoul to be holy; be confident of this that it is ſound faith. Though there be yet remainders of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, yet if the inclination of the ſoul be ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nged by grace, doubt it not, thou haſt faith: But for ſuch as talk of a faith which ſtands in oppoſition to ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ineſſe, and pleaſe themſelves in a <hi>graceleſſe faith,</hi> in ſuch a faith as hath no ſociety or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of graces in the ſoule; O farre be ſuch a faith from any one of us. An <hi>unholy beleever</hi> is as proper a phraſe as an <hi>holy devil. Preſumption</hi> is a <hi>moſt confident work,</hi> but it is a very
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115662:55"/> 
                     <hi>looſe quality,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9. <hi>Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankinde,</hi> verſe 10. <hi>Nor theeves, nor covetous, nor drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>karks, nor revilers, nor extortioners ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you, but you are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Do not abuſe thy ſoul with a conceit of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>juſtification,</hi> if thou haſt no <hi>change of heart by ſanctification.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                  <p>THirdly, a third tryal of true faith in Chriſt Jeſus is this, <hi>It will ſtoop to Chriſt</hi> as well as <hi>riſe to him;</hi> It enters the ſoul into a new ſervice, it takes <hi>Chriſt and him only to be its Lord.</hi> You read that there was a <hi>Marriage feaſt,</hi> to which ſome did come, and there was the <hi>Kings ſon</hi> ſent out to <hi>rule and reigne,</hi> but few yeilded unto him. Many men will come to <hi>Christ</hi> to finde a feaſt, but few come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>bear his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> they would come under the <hi>ſafe-guard</hi> of his <hi>blood,</hi> who flie the <hi>Authority and dominion</hi> of his ſword; they like <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Priest,</hi> but not Chriſt the Lord.</p>
                  <p>I will briefly ſhew you two things to clear this tryal. <note place="margin">2. Things.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, no unbeliever will accept of Chriſt to be his <hi>Lord only;</hi> becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His heart hath another Lord; It hath ſet up ſome ſinne or other, or ſome part of the world or other, to which it gives ſervice as to his Lord. He is our Lord to whom we give ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and <hi>his ſervants we are whom we do obey;</hi> Now the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving heart either ſerves the world, or obeys ſinne in the luſts thereof. Let the commands of ſinne and Chriſt come into an ordinary and uſual competition; let the commands of profit, or pleaſure, and Chriſt come into competition: Now you ſhall ſee, that the unbelieving heart will go after its Lord, it will not hearken to Chriſt, it prefers ſin before him, it will eaſily adventure Chriſts diſpleaſure to fulfil its own luſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:115662:56"/> 2. Againe, his heart cannot <hi>chooſe Chriſt,</hi> it cannot like him for a Lord, Why? becauſe the <hi>dominion of Chriſt is holy</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> and directly oppoſite to the fordid principles and affections and wayes of an unbeleeving heart: It is a burden, yea, a very vexation to ſuch a heart, to heare but the report of the holy Laws of Chriſt, and of their power and authority to oblige the inward man, and the outward converſation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>They take counſel againſt the Lord, and againſt his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, ſaying,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>Let us break their bands aſunder, and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their cords from us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, whether wicked men will ſtoop or no, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>Lord</hi> in reſpect of <hi>deſignation,</hi> but he is not their Lord in reſpect of <hi>approbation; They will not have this man to rule over them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Every Beleever admits of Chriſt to be his Lord;</hi> as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Lord</hi> and <hi>My God,</hi> John 20. 28. ſee &amp;c. and ſo</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith</hi> ſets up the <hi>Scepter of Chriſt,</hi> and ſweetly frames the ſoul to a <hi>willing ſubjection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>faith</hi> takes <hi>whole Chriſt,</hi> and therefore Chriſt is the only <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> to faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, <hi>faith</hi> knows that the <hi>whole perſon is Chriſts purchaſe, his blood</hi> hath bought us, and ſo paſſed us into the entire domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Chriſt; <hi>ye are bought with a price, ye are not your own,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Now then try your ſelves in this, who is your Lord? why brethren? Thus it is, faith gives the propriety, and title, and diſpoſition of our hearts and wayes to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 'Tis true, before we were called to faith in Chriſt, we were <hi>diſobedient, we ſerved divers luſts,</hi> we ſet up our ſins and the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> But now being made partakers of rich mercy and grace in Chriſt, we ſhall ſurely rebel againſt other Lords but Chriſt, (that is) againſt all other Lords whoſe commands are contrary to Jeſus Chriſt; Our hearts are his, and our <hi>affections</hi> his, and our <hi>ſtrength</hi> his, and our <hi>ſervice</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> I deny not but ſinne will be ſtirring, even in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving heart, it will be aſſaulting, it will now and then uſurp
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115662:56"/> upon the ſoul, and vex, and captivate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> But the <hi>rebellion of a ſinful nature</hi> is one thing, and the <hi>dominion</hi> of it is another thing: Sinne will ſtir as an <hi>enemy</hi> where Chriſt doth reign as a <hi>Lord:</hi> But it is one thing for thee to be a combitant with ſinne, another thing for thee to be a <hi>ſervant of ſin.</hi> Not who aſſaults me, but whom I love and ſerve, he is my Lord. When the heart goes off from Chriſt to the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and love, and habitual obedience of ſin; now ſin is thy <hi>Lord:</hi> But if by faith thou haſt ſworne fealty to Chriſt, then though all temptations begirt thee, though the inſolencies of corrupt nature break in upon thee, to captivate, or to alienate thy heart from ſervice to Chriſt, yet amidſt all oppreſſions, yea under all the knocks and buffettings, and interruptions by ſinne, the heart cries out, I acknowledge no Lord but Chriſt, him I would obey, him I honour, I love, his I am, and I yet hate thoſe ſins which yet I cannot conquer.</p>

                  <p>FOurthly, a fourth tryal of true faith is this, <hi>It makes the heart humble and lowly.</hi> Every <hi>unbeleeving heart</hi> is proud, and hath high imaginations, and ſtands upon its own bottom; It hath no ſound experience, either of God or of it ſelf. But true faith caſts a man quite out of himſelfe, it ſees no ground of confidence and excellency from any thing in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Faith hath a double aſpect, 1. One is <hi>upon us.</hi> 2. Another <note place="margin">A double aſpect of faith.</note> is <hi>upon God and Chriſt:</hi> When faith looks <hi>down upon us,</hi> alas it findes no matter of boaſting in the world, for either it findes <hi>ſinnes,</hi> which ſhould abaſe our hearts, or elſe <hi>imperfections,</hi> which ſhould curb our pride, or <hi>wants,</hi> which ſhould ſhew unto us our indigence and dependance. The <hi>Evil</hi> which it findes may <hi>confound</hi> us, and the <hi>good</hi> which it findes may make us <hi>aſhamed;</hi> not only becauſe it is ſo ſhort, and defective in what we ought to have, but alſo becauſe we have not anſwered the giving of that good with juſt thanks, or we have not improved that good to the advantage as we might have done.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:115662:57"/>
                  <p> When <hi>faith looks upward to God and Chriſt,</hi> there it ſees all the cauſes of all our mercy, and of all our happineſſe; have we pardon of ſinnes? why, ſaith Faith, the cauſe of this is <hi>in Gods love.</hi> Have we righteouſneſſe? why, ſaith Faith, the cauſe of this is in <hi>Chriſts merits.</hi> Have we any <hi>gifts,</hi> any acceptance, any remembrance from heaven? why, ſaith faith, the cauſe of this is only in <hi>Chriſts blood.</hi> All that I have is given me, and the cauſe of all that giving, is utterly out of my ſelf, ſo that the ſoul ſits down now and ſayes, O Lord in my ſelfe I am nothing; nay, of my ſelf worſe then nothing; but what I am, I am that by <hi>thy grace.</hi> All I have is thine, my bread, my health, my life, my body, my ſoul, all thine; If any love, if any mercy, if any Chriſt, if any grace, if any comfort, if any ſtrength, if any ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe, if any performances, if a good work, if a good word, if a good affection, if a good thought, why, all is thine, thou only art the cauſe, <hi>I am leſſe then the leaſt of thy mercies,</hi> and <hi>what is thy ſervant that thou ſhouldeſt look on ſuch a one as I am?</hi> Thou madeſt me, and thou boughteſt me, and thou calledſt me, and thou juſtifieſt me, and thou ſaveſt me.

                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>true faith</hi> begins in <hi>weakneſſe.</hi> Like a childe at the firſt, very tender; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> like the light, at the firſt very broken. Preſumption being a work of fancy, and borne with its ſtrength and perfection, it is fully aſſured and utterly confident at firſt. But <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder hath many ſteps.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That though it hath weakneſſe, yet it hath life: as the ſpark of fire, though it be little, yet it is hot, and though the childe be weak, yet it can ſuck; even the <hi>weakeſt faith in Chriſt</hi> will be much about Chriſt, it will be weeping at his grave, or waſhing of his feet, or looking on his perſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are yet <hi>many degrees wanting to faith,</hi> either thou canſt not be perſwaded, or not fully perſwaded, or not conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>4. If the <hi>faith</hi> be <hi>true</hi> and living, it will bend after a <hi>riſing;</hi> and that,</p>

                  <p>Secondly, in reſpect of its <hi>object.,</hi> It would yet apprehend more, and feel more of the communion and vertues of Chriſt. All the preaching in the world doth not increaſe a falſe and preſumptuous faith, nor doth the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adde thereto.

                  <p>There are two parts of ſorrow.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the <hi>immediate and ſpecial cauſe:</hi> weak faith, as faith, comes not from one cauſe, and ſtrong faith from another cauſe, but both the one and the other <hi>from one and the ſame cauſe,</hi> viz. the bleſſed <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> Not onely the flames, but the ſparks of fire are kindled by that Spirit which <hi>blows where it liſts.</hi> As in the Orchard, the tree which ſtands ſtrong, and the tender plant which ſtands trembling, both of them were at firſt ſet by one and the ſame hand, ſo the faith which is now well grown, and that faith which is as yet tender, and full of doubtings, both of them are the peculiar fruits of <hi>Gods ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though this childe in the cradle cannot runne and move as well as that in the field at work, yet the father begat the one as well as the other, and owns them both by vertue of one equal relation. <hi>The day of ſmall things are not deſpiſed</hi> by God, who ſees <hi>weakneſſe in the strongeſt Faith,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>weakeſt,</hi> and is the Parent both of this and that.</p>
                  <p>2. In the <hi>remote and ſingular cauſe.</hi> You know that Gods free grace and <hi>love</hi> is the firſt wheele of all ſingular good unto men; out of it came that great <hi>gift of Chriſt,</hi> and that great work of <hi>Election,</hi> from whence doth flow all the graces which ſanctifie and bring to glory. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life beleeved.</hi> Now all faith is a drop out of this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the weak faith is a fruit of that great love of God <note place="margin">Acts 13. 48.</note>

                     <hi>electing us in Chriſt,</hi> as well as the ſtrong, and is, though not ſo ſenſibly evident, yet as <hi>really a true teſtimony of our election:</hi> The reaſon whereof is this, not <hi>grace</hi> reſtrictively conſidered, but grace in the whole latitude of it is the fruit of Gods <hi>election:</hi> my meaning is this, not only <hi>Graces</hi> as <hi>eminent,</hi> as raiſed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated to ſome more perfect quality and pitch, but <hi>grace in the whole compaſſe of it,</hi> from the conception of it to the perfection of it, from the dawning to the full day, from the nature to the act; from the acts to the degrees; all of it in nature, in parts, <hi>in totum &amp; ſolidum,</hi> all of it whether more or leſſe, ſtrong or weak, all is out of the ſame grace of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>It was not one love which elected him, who is therefore now ſtrong in beleeving with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and another love which elected him, who is now weak in beleeving with the father of the childe; No, but it was one and the ſelf-ſame love which produced this, and that faith; yea, that electing love was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively one in producing of both. It was as equally high to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this perſon as towards that, and was as equally cauſative of the faith that is weak, as of the faith which is ſtrong, being habitually conſidered, and alſo in relation to the grace of Gods love in election.</p>
                  <p>3. In the <hi>ordinary and uſual inſtrumental cauſe:</hi> the ſame womb of the word brought them both forth, being efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <hi>aſſiſted</hi> by that <hi>Almighty Spirit.</hi> That word which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered miſery, and impotency, and neceſſity to the one, did ſo to the other. That word which revealed the Covenant of grace and mercy in Chriſt to the one, did ſo to the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever alſo. That word which did aſſure the one, that if he would come in and accept of Chriſt, be ſhould be ſaved, did alſo of this aſſure the other. That word which did encline the heart of the one to truſt upon Gods promiſe, and ſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, did likewiſe <hi>(being quickened with the ſame Spirit)</hi> draw, and perſwade the other.</p>
                  <p>4. In the lively nature of beleeving: look as the ſtrong and weak man, though they do differ in the meaſure of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet they do agree in the nature of man; though they differ in reſpect of working, yet they agree in reſpect of being. And as the ſick man, and the healthy man, though
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115662:66"/> they vary in their temper, yet they agree in their nature; though they differ in livelihood, yet not in life. So, though the ſtrong and weak faith differ exceedingly in reſpect of particular abilities and exerciſes, yet there is a true nature of faith in the weakeſt as well as in the ſtrongeſt. There is as true a knowledge of the ſinful and miſerable condition in our ſelves, and of the bleſſed condition in Chriſt, in the one as well as in the other. There is as true an aſſent to the <hi>word of grace, the Goſpel of ſalvation,</hi> revealed in the one as well as in the other, I ſay, as true, though, perhaps not <hi>equal and full.</hi> There is as true accepting and embracing of Chriſt, to be <hi>Lord and Saviour;</hi> the will doth as truly receive Chriſt offered, though perhaps there be not ſuch a ſtrength of adherence at the firſt. There is ſo much in the weakeſt faith as makes up the match 'twixt Chriſt and the ſoul, nay, there is not any thing in the ſtrongeſt faith, which is an effectual ingredient to eſpouſe the ſoul with Chriſt but the ſame alſo is in the weakeſt faith. Doth ſtrong faith take Chriſt? ſo doth the weakeſt; doth it acknowledge him the only Saviour? ſo doth the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, doth it embrace him as its Lord? ſo doth the weakeſt; doth it breed union? ſo doth the weakeſt; doth it make a man a member of Chriſt, and heire of promiſes? ſo doth the weakeſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus you briefly perceive the habitual unity of all true faith.</p>

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:115662:66"/>
                  <p> The ſeverall and particular habits of faith, though they conſent in one truth of nature, yet they differ in many things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the <hi>strength of the parts and acts:</hi> As in the eyes of men, though the viſive faculty be equal in all, yet viſion, or the act of ſeeing, is diverſe, one ſees the colours more clearly then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>So is it in faith, (which is the eye of the ſoul,) Though the nature be common, and equall, yet the act of beleeving is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                  <p>There are three <hi>acts of faith,</hi> and in reſpect of all of them, there <note place="margin">Three acts.</note> may be a diverſity among believers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Knowledge and apprehenſion,</hi> this is as it were the ground work of faith; for <hi>believing</hi> is not rooted in <hi>ignorance,</hi> but in <hi>light.</hi> Now every believer hath not ſo full and diſtinct a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as another. <hi>Divine revelations</hi> (which are the generall objects of faith) are not claſped alike by all: No, nor yet the <hi>promiſes,</hi> (which are the ſpecial objects of faith) they are not ſo equally apprehended. There are ſeverall promiſes, and in them ſeverall parts, and degrees of goodneſſe and truth; now, it is poſſible for ſome believers, not to be acquainted with all their treaſuries; they have not been ſo long acquainted with the word as to know all the good which doth concerne them; And that ſpecial good which they do apprehend, one believer reacheth the large compaſſe of it more then another: All (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Chriſt) is not equally known by all, who believe in Chriſt. Hence it is, that age, and time, and communion, and ſtudy, and uſe of meanes, and experience do raiſe the apprehenſion and knowledge to farre more degrees and ſtrength then at the firſt; and the believing ſoul, which at firſt ſaw things (as the <hi>man whoſe eyes were touched by Chriſt)</hi> dimly, at length riſeth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to a more perfect light of the ſame truthes, and to a more full and enlarged apprehenſion of other truths, which he was ignorant of before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Aſſent,</hi> even in this alſo may one beleever differ from another: I confeſſe, the uſual and palpable diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of faith be moſt in things as <hi>good,</hi> rather then in things as <hi>true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe, every believer, as ſo, aſſents to all revelations,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115662:67"/> as in particular to thoſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>true,</hi> yet the aſſents in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may very much, not only in the circumſtances of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but alſo in the immediate workings of the aſſent. The Judgement is not equally captivated in all, or elſe why do ſome believers queſtion and ſcruple more then others? yea, and why elſe needs there a farther evidence and demonſtration, to eſtabliſh ſome in doctrinall truths, if all believers were equally grounded, and rooted in the word?</p>
                  <p>Yea, and why are ſome good people more apt to errors then others? no plauſible error can be taught, or ſpread with the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe of taking reaſon, but preſently they are queſtioning their <hi>old truths,</hi> for <hi>new opinions,</hi> which ſhews, that <hi>all aſſents to divine truths are not alike in all believers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, and this appeares to be ſo by the ſeverall inſtances of <hi>diabolicall temptations,</hi> which in ſome are of that great force, as to make them not only <hi>question their particular intereſts in God and Chriſt,</hi> (which may befall the higheſt believer) but alſo to queſtion <hi>the firſt principles of Religion,</hi> whether <hi>there be a God,</hi> and whether <hi>the Scriptures are his Word,</hi> and whether <hi>true or falſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Reception,</hi> embracing or conſent: though it be hearty and ſincere in all, yet one believer cannot ſo reſt on Chriſt as another, nor doth every one take Chriſt by the hand alike. Like a child who gives out a trembling hand with ſome ſhrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> even to his Father; ſo the believer may put forth his hand of faith, even to Chriſt, with many feares and ſhakings; O that I may have him, that I might receive him, that he would be mine, that I could lay hold on him; O that God would pardon my ſinnes, ſaith one; yet another raiſeth up the ſoul, I will reſt on his promiſe in Chriſt to pardon all.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>meaſure of degrees:</hi> Hence you read of that by Chriſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael,</hi> and, <hi>O woman great is thy faith, Abraham ſtrong in faith, Paul perſwaded, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Job I know that my, &amp;c.</hi> In a comparative oppoſition to which, you read thoſe phraſes, <hi>O ye of little faith.</hi> And <hi>why didſt thou doubt, O thou of little faith;</hi> and <hi>of the weak in faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The degrees of faith are many <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>habitual inclination</hi> of the heart toward Chriſt, the <hi>actual laying hold on him,</hi> the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115662:67"/> 
                     <hi>ſtrong embracing</hi> of him; <hi>reflection of the act,</hi> that I know I take him, as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour; reflection</hi> of the <hi>object,</hi> I know that he is my Lord and Saviour; then, a <hi>fulneſſe of this reflexive aſſurance,</hi> I doubt it not; then the <hi>reaſons of this full aſſurance</hi> (which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it meane the great continuance, or the great abundance of the meaſure of aſſurance, is diſputable) Againe the <hi>longer dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this full and great aſſurance. Now in all theſe reſpects (except the firſt) faith in one may differ from faith in another: How many hearts are ſet only towards Chriſt; O that I could apprehend him, but I cannot believe: How many ſouls do apprehend him? yet, O that we were apprehended by him; how many are apprehended by him, (that is) know him to be theirs, by ſome gracious and firme evidence? yet by and by with <hi>Mary weeping, they have taken away my Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet ſome others riſe high and ſtay long in reſtings, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions in affirmings, that it is heaven with them many dayes together.</p>
                  <p>You may ſee one Chriſtian look up to heaven with <hi>teares of joy,</hi> (as <hi>Job, I know that my redeemer liveth.)</hi> Another look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Job. Pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus it is with ſeverall belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as with ſeverall children: one lies in the cradle, another is led by the nurſe, another is going by the chaires, and another can run. Or as it is with a flock of ſheep, ſome are ſtrong and bearing, others are young, and muſt be gently led or carried; Or as with an Orchard, ſome trees are able and well limbed, others are tender plants, and are weakly riſing.</p>

                  <p>Three queries, how to know, 1. Whether our faith be great, 2. or little, 3. and yet true.</p>
                  <p>You ſee there are two parts of this, I will begin with the firſt, which reſpects the diſcoveries of faith in ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which take theſe things briefly. <hi>Signes of a great</hi>

                     <hi>and ſtrong faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Confidence of eaſie anſwers for great matters</hi> is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſtrong and great faith. As in the Centurion, who came to Chriſt for the <hi>healing of his ſervant,</hi> who was ſick of a <hi>palſey</hi> and grievouſly tormented, <hi>ſpeak the word only and my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhall be healed,</hi> (that is) Though he be very weak, yet I am confident that thy power is very ſtrong, thou needeſt not to trouble thy perſon, one word from thy pleaſure will heal him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8. What ſaith Chriſt now of this faith? See <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily, I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> The more difficult we eſteem things to be in God or Chriſt, the weaker is our faith: If we impoſe a different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of help, or mercy, or pardon, on God, according to the different matter which we are putting up unto him, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues want of ſtrength: For it is all one with God <hi>to pardon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,</hi> as to pardon ſingly; and <hi>his power,</hi> is as able for the <hi>greateſt difficulty,</hi> as for the leaſt trouble. But when the ſoul draws neer unto him, and can beleeve great matters, as well as ſmall things; that he will be <hi>merciful</hi> to <hi>great transgreſſions,</hi> as well as <hi>compaſſionate</hi> to <hi>ordinary infirmities;</hi> that he will ſubdue <hi>ſtrong temptations,</hi> as well as <hi>weak glancings;</hi> that he will in time conquer the buſieſt inclination to ſin, &amp;c. this ſhews that faith is come to ſome ſtrength.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againe, a <hi>repetition of adherence</hi> and a <hi>ſtedfaſt following of Christ,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>diſcouragements,</hi> which the ſoule may be apt to take from Chriſts behaviour towards it, argues their faith to be ſtrong, and great, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 16. They were the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115662:69"/> 
                     <hi>three mighty men that brake through the Hoſt, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem,</hi> Matth. 15. 22. As in that <hi>woman of Canaan,</hi> who came to Chriſt to heal her daughter; <hi>Have mercy on me O Lord, thou ſonne of David;</hi> how did Chriſt entertaine her? (the text ſaith, <hi>he anſwered her not a word)</hi> yet in the ſame verſe it is ſaid, <hi>ſhe cryeth after thee;</hi> (Chriſts ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence raiſed her voice the higher) Againe, <hi>ſhe came and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him, ſaying, Lord, help me,</hi> how is ſhe now anſwered? <hi>(It is not meet to take the childrens bread and to caſt it to dogs;)</hi> ſuch an anſwer to ſome ſpirits, had been far worſe then ſilence; But mark it, her faith followed Chriſt ſtill, and that very word which would diſcourage another, encouraged her; (O, that faith is ſtrong which can urge Chriſt from a ſmall hint) <hi>Truth Lord,</hi> ſaid ſhe, yea, <hi>the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their Maſters Table.</hi> As if ſhe might ſay, Be it ſo Lord Jeſus, I am no better then a dogge, an unworthy creature, yet let me have the compaſſions to a dogge, though not plenty, yet the crumbs. Now, what ſaith Chriſt of her? <hi>Then Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, O woman, great is thy faith.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, that the faith which can bring up the ſoul which can lead it up to heaven againſt diſcouragements. Though God doth not anſwer, yet I will ſeek; though he <hi>kill me, yet I will truſt in him:</hi> I ſay, ſuch a faith is ſtrong; an <hi>expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating faith,</hi> a faith which will make the ſoul to preſſe on after denials, <note place="margin">Job.</note> after ſuſpenſions; it is come to a great meaſure of faith, which will not be anſwered, or will not be gone; a faith that will not let God go, or Chriſt until it ſpeed. <hi>Jacob</hi> was as a wreſtler, he would not let <hi>God go except he bleſſed him.</hi> A faith that can <hi>diſpute</hi> it much with God, which will in a holy reaſoning, take and urge God with God, and will ſo enforce the promiſes on him (which he hath made) that God is even faine to yeild, <hi>Be it unto thee as thou wilt,</hi> this is <hi>faith ripened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The more entirely the <hi>ſoul is carried to expectation from the ſole ſtrength of a Divine promiſe,</hi> the greater and the ſtronger is that faith. As in <hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe; He wanted a ſonne, and God promiſed him an <hi>Iſaac; Abraham</hi> did not now <hi>ſtagger through unbelief,</hi> he did not conſult the truth of it from his own <hi>natural abilities;</hi> How <hi>unable</hi> he was, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115662:69"/> he neglected, but <hi>how able God was</hi> to perform his own word, upon this his faith did pitch. And for this the text ſaith, that <hi>he was ſtrong in faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 20. Remember this, that the more <hi>ſenſible helps</hi> the ſoul needs to draw out the <hi>act of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> the weaker is the <hi>faith;</hi> as the man is judged to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak, who cannot go without many crutches and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; But the more ſtrength <hi>a naked promiſe</hi> hath with the ſoule, when it alone puts life and quietneſſe into us, now faith is grown; As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord is on my ſide, I will not fear what man can do unto me.</hi> So when we can quaſh all our troubles with the ſight of a promiſe, I have Gods word for my pardon, his word for my help, his Word for my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, I deſire no better pay-maſter then God, no better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then his own promiſe; though all things ſtand contrary in ſenſe and feeling, yet all is ſure in Gods promiſe, and there I will ſettle, this argues a great faith.</p>
                  <p>4. The more <hi>ability</hi> a man hath to <hi>deny himſelf</hi> in <hi>neare and great occurrences,</hi> the greater is his faith: <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>leaving of his countrey,</hi> parting with <hi>Iſaac:</hi> The more eaſily we can beleeve great things, and part with great things, the ſtronger is our faith. There is nothing more hard then to <hi>give up a mans ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a threefold ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>his ſinful ſelf</hi> in reſpect of old and dear ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, his <hi>natural ſelf,</hi> in reſpect of the ſeparation of ſoul and body.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his <hi>temporal ſelf</hi> in reſpect of the comforts of this life. And it muſt be a <hi>ſtrong faith</hi> which muſt enable to ſtrong <hi>denials of our ſelves,</hi> when a thing comes nearer to the quick, either when God denies a man a ſpecial comfort, or draws off from him a ſpecial comfort; now to ſubmit, now to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul; I know how to want, and how to abound, to be exalted and to be abaſed, I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be contented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To have the heart pleaſed with Chriſt alone, and ſatisfied with his preſence, mark it, the more entirely that the ſoul makes up its ſtate in Chriſt, and the leſſe power that the world im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints upon the heart in its changes, this imports the faith is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115662:70"/> come to ſtrength. Strong faith is like a ſtrong tree, which holds its body unmovable againſt great tempeſts, but weak faith is like a plant which every winde makes almoſt to touch the ground.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the <hi>weaker the arguments of diſtruſt grow in the heart;</hi> this is a ſigne that the <hi>faith is got to a ſtrength.</hi> This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that the ſtrength or weakneſſe of faith is not to be judged by the <hi>multiplicity of diſtruſtful arguments,</hi> but by the <hi>force and efficacy of them;</hi> It is poſſible that manifold argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of feare, and doubts may preſent themſelves to the minde of a ſtrong beleever, as well as unto the judgement of a weak beleever, but then, if faith be ſtrong, it doth weigh them down, it doth prevaile over them, (that is) it brings the ſoul to Chriſt; it cleaves ſtill unto him. The ſoul maintaines its title to Chriſt, and owns God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, it will not caſt away its hope, nor its ſtrength, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſoul can habitually foyle the reaſonings which croſſe its way, and can cleare up and vindicate its ſtate, what God is to it, and Chriſt is to it, and what it hath received from them, this is an argument, that it is not weak but ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>the more eaſie compliance with change of a mans condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is an evidence of a faith which is more ſtrong. There are ſeveral changes incident to mans temporal life, the <hi>Moon</hi> ſometimes is ful, and anon it is in the <hi>Eclipſe;</hi> our <hi>ſea</hi> doth <hi>ebb and flow;</hi> ſometimes <hi>proſperity</hi> (like the <hi>candle of the Lord)</hi> ſhines upon us; by and by <hi>adverſity</hi> (like the <hi>winde)</hi> blows out the candle; ſometimes we <hi>abound</hi> and our <hi>mountaine ſeemes ſtrong;</hi> anon we are ſtript and our mountaine is ſhaked; one while health and preſence of friends; another while ſickneſſe and loſſe of all. Now in theſe changes, not to be changed, like the ſhip right up in a calme, but toſſing and reeling in a ſtorme, but to be as the rock fixed and ſetled, holding up, and <hi>rejoycing in the God of our ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>encouraging our ſelves in the Lord our God,</hi> and willing to be any thing; in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yea, <hi>to bleſſe God for all as Job did.</hi> If I die, I ſhall go to God; If I live, I will ſerve my God; If I enjoy, I will be fruitful; If I want, I will be thankful; The more <hi>Paſſive</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> is, the more <hi>active</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> the <hi>faith</hi> is. <hi>Paul</hi> had been learning that leſſon; <hi>In every ſtate, therewith to be content.</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:115662:70"/> O when a Chriſtian can comply with contrary ſtates, not through an <hi>inſenſibleneſſe of Spirit,</hi> but from an apprehenſion and <hi>approbation of divine wiſdome, goodneſſe, love</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> his faith is ſingularly cleared and well impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>7. The more <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> and <hi>quieſcence that the ſoul hath in Chriſt alone,</hi> the greater is the faith; when a <hi>naked Chriſt,</hi> is the centre and loadſtone, and the <hi>All in all,</hi> As the Sunne to make day, <hi>I deſire to know nothing but Chriſt crucified,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee,</hi> ſaid <hi>Aſaph,</hi> Pſalme 73. 25. <hi>I count all things but loſſe for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> again, Phil. 3. 8. <hi>Lord, let thy ſervant now depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation,</hi> ſaid <hi>Simeon,</hi> Luke 2. 29, 30. As when we come to heaven, we ſhall be ſo heavenly, that <hi>heaven alone</hi> will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to us, and this ſhews perfection; ſo whiles we live on earth, if <hi>Chriſt alone</hi> be heaven and earth to us; if he can <hi>fill our hearts,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfie them. O Lord Jeſus,</hi> thou art righteouſneſſe enough, ſatisfaction enough, wiſdome enough, peace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and pleaſure enough to my ſoul: O this comes from great ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>8. The more that <hi>the body of ſinne decayes in strength,</hi> the leſſer prevalency of it, this ſhewes that faith is ſtrong. When ſinne becomes more dead in its <hi>actions,</hi> or more <hi>ineffectual</hi> in its <hi>temptations;</hi> When a man can walk and not ſtumble, and reele and fall; he is now out-grown his former weakneſſe; It ſhews weakneſſe, when every ſtone makes thee apt to fall; It is a ſigne the army is ſtrong, when the enemy many of them are ſlaine, and the reſt are eaſily diſcomfited. Sinne is our enemy, and Chriſt is our general, and faith is our cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, and the more that ſinnes fall, it is an argument that faith is become ſtronger. The <hi>victorious</hi> faith is much more then the <hi>combating</hi> faith: Sinnes go down by believing; the more that any grace is in victory the more it is in ſtrength. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it argues truth of faith to reſiſt, but to conquer ſinnes, this ſhewes ſtrength, to wreſtle is ſomething, but to overthrow is more; to oppoſe ſin, is not ſo much as to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh it.</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:115662:71"/>
                  <p> 10. The more <hi>fruitful a Chriſtian is in his graces and exerciſes of them,</hi> the ſtronger is his faith. You know that the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the branches ariſeth from the intenſion of the ſap; if the branches grow big, and yeild more fruit, it is becauſe the root is more full and filled. <hi>Faith is</hi> (well ſtiled) <hi>the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal grace;</hi> though the habits of other graces grow not out of it, yet the meaſures and exerciſes do exceedingly depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: And, according to the latitude of faith is the latitude of other graces; as the dayes receive ſhortneſſe or length from the Sunne. A weak faith is attended but with a weak love, and a weak patience, and a weak hope, and a weak joy. But if the faith becomes ſtrong, now it is ſpring with our graces, they revive and ſhoot out themſelves, there will be much love, and much labour of love, and ſtrong hope, and the better heart and life.</p>
                  <p>11. The more able a perſon is to <hi>live upon Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Gods promiſes</hi> in the <hi>times of deſertions and contrarieties,</hi> the faith is certainly the greater. The more uſe any can make of God or Chriſt at all, his faith is greater; for the more that any ſoule beleeves, the more is his faith enabled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                  <p>But then this is yet more ſtrength, even <hi>againſt hope, to believe in hope,</hi> to look up for that God that hides himſelf; to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on an angry God, one who ſeemes to <hi>ſhut out our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> one that ſpeaks <hi>bitter things unto us,</hi> like <hi>Levi,</hi> not to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our own children,</hi> but to <hi>keep the Word and Covenant of God,</hi> Deut. 33 9.</p>
                  <p>12. The more able the <hi>ſoul is to wait on God;</hi> to pray and wait, the ſtronger is the Faith. <hi>A waiting faith</hi> meets <hi>with more difficulties,</hi> and contrarieties, and is upheld by the ſtrength of a meer promiſe. That man not only hath faith, but <hi>lives by faith,</hi> if he can wait Gods time, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>13. When you can <hi>glorifie many promiſes at once</hi> by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; yea, when every promiſe can be truſted on upon graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous termes, the more fully you can glorifie them by truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for pardon of great ſinnes, ſubduing of ſtrong corruptions, deliverance out of great diſtreſſes, the ſtronger is your faith. The leſſe difficulty you conceive in God to perform his Word; when you can come for great matters, with great confidence,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115662:71"/> leſſe doubts, exceptions, feare, the leſſe power diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have. If you can beleeve againſt ſenſe, reaſon, <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> Theſe are diſcoveries of faith in ſtrength.</p>

                  <p>THe ſecond part of the ſecond general point at the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of weak <hi>faith in truth.</hi> Here are two things which I will touch.</p>
                  <p>One is, ſome demonſtrations <hi>that faith is weak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another is, ſome directions of <hi>truth with that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt, obſerve theſe things. <note place="margin">Signes of a weak faith.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The more that doubtings ſtagger the heart, its is a ſign that the faith is weak. As the more ſmoak goes up with the fire, it is an argument that the fire is little, or as the more a perſon halts and reels in his motion, it diſcovers the impotency of his ſtrength and joynts. You reade in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. That <hi>ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering at the promiſe by unbelief,</hi> is oppoſed to a <hi>ſtrong faith:</hi> obſerve that word <hi>(ſtaggering)</hi> It is ſuch a temper of the ſoul, wherein it doth ſuddenly and eaſily change its thoughts, and acts: As a man who is ſtaggering, his foot checks (as it were) it ſelf, and alters its pace and place, ſo when a mans heart is giving on, and then falling off, may I take? may I not? I will lay hold, I will not; God will be good to me, he will not; I ſhall have mercy, yet I ſhall not; this is ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The ſoul lets go its hold, doubtings prevaile againſt actual beleeving; the <hi>beleeving ſoul</hi> ſees ſtrong arguments to draw it to faſten on Chriſt, and on mercy, and then it is putting forth the hand; but then unbelief thruſts forth contrary arguments of ſuſpition, and feares, ſo that the ſoul is in doubts; may I indeed lay hold, but will the Lord be merciful to me? <hi>Why diddeſt thou doubt, O thou of little faith,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Peter?</hi> and this ſtands with reaſon, for the ſtronger that quality
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115662:72"/> is which is contrary to faith, the weaker is that faith which is contrary to that quality, as the ſtronger ſickneſs is, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er health is, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The more <hi>eaſily a man can ſuſpect Gods favour and Chriſts love;</hi> this is a ſign that faith is weak. See <hi>Pſalme</hi> 77. 7, 8, 9. and then <hi>v.</hi> 10. They ſay of <hi>love,</hi> that the more <hi>pure love</hi> hath <hi>least feare.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 18 and multitude of jealouſies is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mixture in the affections. So it is of faith, the more ſtedfaſtly it can hold up the immutability of Gods love and kindneſſe, and his ancient grants of favour, the ſtronger is the faith: But the more apt it is to queſtion the loving <hi>kindneſſe which hath been ever of old;</hi> now it is the weaker, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21. <hi>We had truſted that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael, and beſides all this to day is the third day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be two things which a weak faith is very apt to challenge.</p>
                  <p>One in God for <hi>kindneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another in its own eſtate for <hi>ſoundneſſe.</hi> As <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid in another caſe, <hi>If the Lord be with us, why is all this evil befallen us?</hi> ſo where the faith is weak, the ſoul is often in ſuit with God; yea, but if God were my God; had I an intereſt in Chriſt, were my eſtate good, could it be with me thus, could it be thus within me, thus without me, thus upon me? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The more <hi>quick and haſtening that the ſoul is for anſwer</hi> and ſatisfactions, the more impatient of <hi>Gods delayings,</hi> this is a ſigne that it is now weak in faith. For did it throughly beleeve, it <hi>would not make haſte,</hi> were it perſwaded fully of Gods <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> which makes the promiſe of his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> which will take the fitteſt time for the grant, it would now quietly <hi>wait and expect:</hi> But an over-haſtening, when the ſoul will ſcarce allow any time 'twixt the petition and the ſpeeding of it, but I muſt preſently have it, or elſe <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>my God,</hi> or elſe my ſtate is bad. I ſay, haſty eagerneſſe to be anſwered, and quick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from Gods ſilence, do ſhew much weakneſſe of faith in the ſoul; There is an <hi>importunity</hi> which may <hi>come from faith,</hi> and this is a holy preſſing of a promiſe, yet with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and patience; And there is an <hi>haſtineſſe</hi> which comes
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115662:72"/> from <hi>feare:</hi> As if God would not alwayes be in a good mind towards us, as if the preſent teſtimonies muſt be the only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of his love and intentions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two things will uſually meet in a man whoſe faith is weak.</p>
                  <p>One is, he will be <hi>haſty</hi> to be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Another is, he will be <hi>faint</hi> if delayed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The more <hi>inclining the heart</hi> is to the <hi>life of ſenſe,</hi> the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the faith: like <hi>Thomas, unleſſe he ſeeth the print of the nails, &amp;c. he will not beleeve,</hi> John 20. 25. So unleſſe Chriſtians have <hi>promiſes budding,</hi> they will hardly beleeve that there is <hi>fruit growing on them;</hi> unleſſe I feele the ſenſible favour of God, I will not beleeve that he loves me; unleſſe I reade my pardon, I will not beleeve mercy; unleſſe I diſcerne ſenſible meanes, I will not beleeve helps; unleſſe I feele ſin ſlaine in me, I will not beleeve that God will ſubdue it; All theſe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes affect not, and ſupport not the heart. It is a ſigne of a weak childe, that muſt ſtill be carried in the armes. When a mans perſwaſions cannot be wrought by the naked <hi>word of promiſe,</hi> without ſome ſenſible pledges and pawne, he is very weak. When he is puzling his heart in an endleſſe maze of diſorder, <hi>viz.</hi> he would have the things of the promiſe, and then beleeve the fidelity of the promiſe, this argues weakneſs. The abſtractions of things from ſenſe, when God gathers up all a mans eſtate, or any particular good, only into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, into his own hand, and ſaith, now canſt thou beleeve that I will be good unto thee? I promiſe thee to be thus and thus; wilt thou now truſt me, wilt thou adventure thy ſoule now upon my word of pardon and mercy, upon my word of gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and help? ſo to do would evidence much ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Now you may obſerve a manifeſt difference 'twixt ſtrong and weak faith; If ſtrong faith ſeeth its eſtate in the promiſe, it hath enough, it goes away rejoycing; if weak faith hath not ſome of the eſtate in its own hand, as well as in <hi>Gods hand,</hi> it is troubled and afraid.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The more <hi>hardly a beleever comes to be perſwaded</hi> and <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Gods undertakings in Covenant,</hi> his faith is weak. When one word of God is not enough, but God muſt ſay it once and twice, and yet againe more clearly: As <hi>Gideon</hi> would have one
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115662:73"/> ſigne, the <hi>fleece muſt be wet,</hi> and <hi>the earth dry;</hi> and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſigne, the <hi>fleece muſt be dry, and dew lie upon all the earth,</hi> Judges 6. 37, 39. This ſhewed weakneſſe in his faith; ſo doth it in a Chriſtian, when not one or two promiſes, and ſcarce all of them, with all the arguments in God and in Chriſt, can perſwade him that God will be merciful to him, or that Chriſt belongs to him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>more eaſie the ſoule is to let go that aſſurance,</hi> the weaker is faith in it; when a ſoul is like a weak hand claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtaff, and the ſtaffe is eaſily wriſted out; ſo the ſoul lets go that promiſe, which did revive it, and that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which ſeemed to embrace it, this argues weakneſſe; as in <hi>Peter,</hi> when he <hi>beleeved that it was Chriſt on the ſea, upon Chriſts Word</hi> he ventures out, but when the waves met him, he <hi>begins to ſink,</hi> his faith was weak, <hi>Why didſt thou doubt, O thou of little faith,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to him? Though <hi>Chriſts Word</hi> drew him out of the ſhip, yet it did not hold him up all alone; And the Diſciples, <hi>We truſted it had been he who ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.</hi> So when a temptation comes upon a ſoul, and the ſoul is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be led by it, to credit it againſt Gods promiſe, and Gods teſtimony in the conſcience, this aptneſſe to let go our hold argues much feare, and much feare argues weak faith.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The more <hi>apt the ſoul is to inſiſt on perſonal and inherent qualities and abilities,</hi> as <hi>media fiduciae,</hi> meanes of perſwaſion, this ſhews that the faith is weak: when ſomething in us makes us the more confident, as when it is unapt to beleeve, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it can diſcerne ſuch an inherent ſtrength of graces, to mourne, and to pray, or to keep down ſinne, or keep off temptation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It is true, theſe abilities are <hi>teſtimonies,</hi> but yet they are not <hi>Media.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> They are <hi>evidences</hi> of a <hi>ſolid faith,</hi> but they are not <hi>meanes</hi> or <hi>cauſes of beleeving.</hi> The means or cauſes are <hi>Gods promiſes,</hi> which ought (alone) to be our <hi>foundations</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements.</hi> Now when a perſon is unapt to beleeve that God will do theſe things for him, unleſſe theſe things be done, this is weakneſſe. Good things, when they are done, they are matters of thankfulneſſe, and when they are promiſed, they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115662:73"/> are matters of faith. They ſay in Logick, that <hi>demonſtratio à po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriori,</hi> is the weaker demonſtration, that <hi>à priori</hi> is much ſtronger: for this depends on the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and that on the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. So is it in beleeving. A beleeving, <hi>à priori,</hi> from the perſwaſion of what God ſaith, (from his goodneſſe and truth) is more ſtrong then a beleeving <hi>à poſteriori</hi> (that is) from a fruition or apprehenſion of what God doth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The more <hi>dull and uncheerful the heart is,</hi> this ſhews the faith to be weak: A <hi>ſad Spirit</hi> and a <hi>weak faith,</hi> uſually are companions: for a ſtrong faith breeds much peace in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2. <hi>and rejoycing,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. <hi>In whom (though now ye ſee him not) yet beleeving ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory:</hi> ſuch a faith as this hath got to much aſſurance, but uncheerfulneſſe of heart argues either, as yet the want of all aſſurance, or aſſurance very weak.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The more <hi>anxious and careful the ſoule is,</hi> it is a ſigne of a weak faith. <hi>What ſhall we eate, and what ſhall we drink, and what ſhall we put on?</hi> This our Saviour ſaith in <hi>Matthew</hi> 6. ſhewes little faith. For the leſſer the things are for which we are to truſt, the more weakneſſe is there if we do diſtruſt, eſpecially where the helper is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and willing, and hath paſt his promiſe; Now, God is willing to do for Beleevers more then all the earth is worth, and hath done greater matters for them; And therfore a ſuſpition of him for ſmall matters, ſhews but a ſmall perſwaſion.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The more <hi>apt the heart is to be offended at the eſtate of Chriſt,</hi> it is a ſigne that faith is weak. This is evident in the Diſciples who being weak in faith, Chriſt was forced to keep many things in, becauſe <hi>they were not able to bear them;</hi> and when he ſpake of his ſufferings, and departing from them, they were much amazed and troubled.</p>

                  <p>THus for the diſcoveries of faith in weakneſſe: Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the demonſtrations of the <hi>truth in faith though weak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of faith hath a great latitude, it is not confined to ſuch an height, to ſuch a point of eminency, as ſome conceive: Look as heat hath ſeverall degrees, and as health hath many <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and as life hath many ſteps within which the true nature of them may be ſeated, ſo is it with faith, the true nature of it may be in a great meaſure, and yet in a leſſer meaſure, and though weak faith be not ſtrong, yet it is faith: weakneſſe is not like death, which is oppoſed to life, but like infirmity, which is oppoſed to ſtrength. Strong faith is weak faith more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and weak faith is ſtrong faith in diſpoſition, in tendancy; it is within the compaſſe. Negation is one thing, imperfection is another thing; no faith is quite oppoſite to faith, but weak faith if it be oppoſed to ſtrength, yet it is not oppoſed to truth.</p>
                  <p>Now the truth of weak faith may appeare in theſe <note place="margin">5. Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the truth of weak faith.</note> things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, though weak faith be not <hi>ſure that Chriſt is its Saviour</hi> yet weak faith <hi>will honour Chriſt as its Lord:</hi> though it cannot ſee Chriſt, beſtowing it ſelf on the ſoul, yet it will make the ſoul to reſigne up it ſelf to Chriſt: Though it cannot finde comfort, yet it will oppoſe ſin: though it cannot comprehend Chriſt, yet it would not willingly offend Chriſt. <hi>Faith in ſtrength</hi> can put out it ſelfe <hi>in perſwaſion, I know that my redeemer liveth,</hi> Job 19. Yet <hi>faith in weakneſſe,</hi> (as was that of <hi>Thomas) can put forth it ſelf in ſubjection, My Lord, and My God;</hi> I will have no Lord but Chriſt, <hi>Io.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>vitall act of faith</hi> is not reflexive but direct. It is not this Chriſt is mine, but this I receive, and embrace Chriſt, now the weak faith cannot ſetle its title to Chriſt, ſo as ſtrong faith can do, yet it can vindicate the title that Chriſt hath to the ſoul, though it cannot ſee its own propriety in Chriſt, yet it can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Chriſts propriety to it, it doth acknowledge, it doth yield unto no Law, or power, or right, over the ſoul but Chriſts: it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115662:74"/> looks on ſinne as an enemy, though it cannot ſee Chriſt as a friend.</p>
                  <p>2. What weak faith doth want in the <hi>breadth of perſwaſion,</hi> that it makes up in the <hi>depth of humility.</hi> A weak believer, though he cannot ſee himſelf <hi>great in Gods eyes,</hi> yet he doth appeare <hi>low in his own eyes:</hi> it will not quarrell with God, becauſe he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens himſelf no more, but abaſeth it-ſelf, becauſe it is moſt <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the leaſt of truth and goodneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be two things which all true faith will work.</p>
                  <p>One is to <hi>value Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another is to <hi>under value our ſelves;</hi> It can put glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on Chriſt, and take ſhame to it ſelfe; He is the ſweeteſt Saviour, and I am the greateſt ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Faith uſually acts in one of theſe, either in receiving or in aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: For either it makes the ſoul to ſee its happineſſe in Chriſt, which breeds joyfulneſſe, or to ſee its own unworthy vileneſſe, becauſe of ſin, and ſo it cauſeth lowlineſſe of ſpirit. Strong faith (like <hi>John)</hi> can be in Chriſts boſome but weak faith, (like <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)</hi> will fall down at Chriſts feet; ſtrong faith may be ſeen by the eye, and weak faith by the knee, that ſtands up and bleſſed God for Chriſt, this falls down and begs of God for Chriſt. And this, not <hi>for my ſake O Lord, (for to me belongs nothing but ſhame and confuſion,) but for thy goodneſſe ſake, O Lord, (for to thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long mercies and forgiveneſſes.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Weak faith,</hi> though it hath but <hi>tender confidences of its interest in Chriſt,</hi> yet it hath ſtrong diſlikes, and combates with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief which hinders his perſwaſion. Though weak faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee Chriſt as its eaſe, &amp;c. yet it can feel unbelief as its burden and trouble.</p>
                  <p>There are two things (if I miſtake not) which accompanie all true faith, and the weakeſt.</p>
                  <p>One is to <hi>magnifie the state in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another is to <hi>diſlike the ſtate out of Chriſt:</hi> O happy is that man, who can comprehend, as he is comprehended, ſaith weak faith, and what ſhall I do with this unbelieving heart, this doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſuſpecting, fearful heart? ſhall I alwaies queſtion, ſhall I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies find theſe diſputings, carnal reaſonings, reelings, ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? <hi>Lord help this unbelief,</hi> Lord perſwade this heart of mine,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115662:75"/> cauſe it to truſt in thy ſalvation in Chriſt, <hi>ſay unto my ſoul, that thou art my ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>weak beleever</hi> hath many prayers in his heart, many tears in his eyes, and many conflicts in his minde; he believes and doubts, he prayes and doubteth, he mornes and doubteth, yet though he doubts he will believe, and though he doubts he will pray, and becauſe he ſtill doubts he will therefore ſtill morne. He looks often towards Chriſt, O that I could believe, he looks often on his own heart, why wilt thou not yet believe, he looks up to God; O make me to believe, ſometimes he ſpends his time in prayer for more faith, ſomtimes in diſpute with his weak faith, one maine difference 'twixt him and the ſtrong believer is this, that the ſtrong believer hath got into Chriſts armes; and this weak beleever is fighting for the way unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Weakfaith,</hi> will not reſt in weakneſſe, if truth be in it. In a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> weak child, well and living, there are two qualifications of life, one is this, that it is <hi>Active;</hi> another is this, that it is <hi>Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> it will be doing, and it will be encreaſing. So it is with al true faith, though weak: it is a drawing of the ſoul unto Chriſt, yea it is a drawing of ſomething more from Chriſt unto the ſoul; what hinders it, that grieves it, and what it wants, after that it longs, and craves. No grace is right which is idle, or labours not to exceed it ſelf. <hi>Lord help my unbelief,</hi> ſaid that weak believer. <hi>O</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord encreaſe our faith,</hi> ſaid they of little faith. The <hi>weak criple,</hi> he would be <hi>lying at the Pool,</hi> and ſo will weak faith, it will be at the <hi>meanes of ſtrength:</hi> It loves to be doing about Chriſt, and to be where the ſtrength of Chriſt is revealed.</p>
                  <p>It is wiſe to obſerve the grounds of its fears and doubtings, and carefull to remove them. O how earneſt is the weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to heare what God will ſpeak unto him, and if at any time the ſoul can get by the aſſiſtance of the Word, to cloſe with mercy and Chriſt, it is revived with joy of tears, and falls down with thanks, <hi>Lord what is thy ſervant!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, if it hath apprehended but a hint, but a creviſe, if it be enabled but a little to ſtep above its dark doubtings, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend but a darting beame, any perſwaſion that all is well or will be ſo, it is refreſhed, and ſaith that <hi>God is good.</hi> I obſerve that the weak childe will be much after the breaſts, and the weak man
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115662:75"/> will handle his ſtaffe much, and the weak believer will be much at the places and ordinances, and wayes of more ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>It is with faith, as it is with a blade of corn, at the firſt the eare of graine is quite skinned over, yet it breaks open aſide and at length is the very top of the ſtalk. So faith at firſt is ſwathed over with doubtings, (none but a tender and merciful God can ſee that little muſtard-ſeed) but at length, it opens to more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence on God and Chriſt, and promiſes, and in time it can tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph againſt its former feares and ſuſpitions. Or it is like a weak man recovering: if he can but ſtand, its well, then if he can ſet on in a few paces with his ſtaff, then if his motion can be ſingle, then if longer, then if ſtronger; ſo is it with faith, if it can make the ſoul to look upon Chriſt, then if it could <hi>look on him as mine,</hi> then if ſo <hi>without fear,</hi> then if ſo <hi>with joy,</hi> then if ſo with <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and ſtedfaſtneſſe.</p>
                  <p>It will not <hi>rest in weakneſs,</hi> though it <hi>begins in weakneſs,</hi> but like the weak Ivie which is winding up the tree, ſo will faith be winding up the ſoul higher and higher into Chriſt by the help of his Spirit, of his Promiſes, of his Word, and of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Weak faith</hi> will yet <hi>venture the ſoul upon Chriſt, though it cannot cleare its title,</hi> nor <hi>anſwer its feares,</hi> nor (to its own ſenſe) <hi>rely on Chriſt;</hi> yet if the ſoul be put and determined to one of theſe, either to renounce all hope in Chriſt, and ſo to be loſt, or to put it ſelf upon Chriſt, though it hath no inward encouragement from it ſelf: I ſay at ſuch a time, even weak faith will diſcover it ſelf, it will not renounce its hidden intereſt in Chriſt, but will roule the ſoul on him; <hi>If I periſh, I periſh,</hi> yet I will cleave to Chriſt, yet I will caſt my ſoul on him and on his blood, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI.</head>
                  <p>THe third general which we obſerved to the former ſcruple <note place="margin">6. The concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all faith in foure things.</note> was the <hi>concordance of all faith</hi> which is true (whether ſtrong or weak) <hi>in fundamentall comforts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:115662:76"/>
                  <p> Firſt, every believer hath a <hi>ſure intereſt in Chriſt;</hi> It is with the members of Chriſt, as with the members of the body, though they are not all of <hi>equall ſtrength,</hi> in a compariſon one with the other, yet they are of <hi>equall conjunction</hi> in a <hi>relation of all of them to the head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So one believer exceeds another in a ſpecial meaſure of faith, yet every believer is a member firmly and ſurly knit to Chriſt, the head of all believers. Chriſt is not the <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> only of the ſtrong, but alſo of the weak, not only the old man, nor only the young man, but alſo the children, the little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, (to whom Saint <hi>John wrote)</hi> they are all in Chriſt: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>There is a wide difference 'twixt <hi>reflexive certainty,</hi> and 'twixt <hi>real certainty of intereſt,</hi> ſtrong faith hath the pre-eminence of weak faith, in reſpect of a reflexive and ſenſible certainty, but not in reſpect of a reall certainty, this is univocal, the union 'twixt Chriſt and the ſoul, doth not depend upon the ſtrength, but upon the truth of faith; If my will conſents unto Chriſt, if my heart accepts of him upon his own tearmes, if I take his whole perſon and his whole condition, the match is truly made 'twixt Chriſt and me, he is ſurely mine, and I am ſurely his. Although I am not in an aſſured condition, yet I am in a ſure union, Chriſt doth certainly own that ſoul, which by faith doth truly embrace him: <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 10. He ſpeaks of the Diſciples, and of all the Elect, who were the fathers in reſpect of a gracious election, and gift, and Chriſts in reſpect of a <hi>tender affection and union.</hi> So that here is one concordance of all faith in reſpect of fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall comfort, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>objective unity</hi> is one and common, the weak and the ſtrong eye meet in the ſame colours as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and weak and ſtrong faith, are two different hands, yet both of them upon one and the ſame Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, every believer hath a <hi>beneficial intereſt in Chriſt:</hi> (that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) weak faith hath an intereſt in the benefits of Chriſt, as well as the ſtrong faith.</p>
                  <p>I will inſtance in ſome ſpecial and choiſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Redemption</hi> from the <hi>Malediction of the Law,</hi> Chriſt took that off, <hi>He was made a curſe for all that believe on him:</hi> He
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115662:76"/> did not ſtand in the room only of eminent, but of every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and endured the wrath to the utmoſt for every one who doth believe on him.</p>
                  <p>Thou art freed from a curſed eſtate by the leaſt faith; every degree of true faith makes the condition to be a ſtate of life, and <hi>paſſeth us from death and condemnation. There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> what Chriſt ſaid to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent perſon, <hi>Sonne be of good cheer, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee,</hi> that is true of every beleever, Chriſt hath purchaſed a pardon for him, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38. <hi>Be it known unto you, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> Ver. 39. <hi>And by him all that beleeve are juſtified, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any believer went without his diſcharge, then probable it is that the weakeſt ſhould be he, but the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>weakeſt faith,</hi> makes it an hand <hi>holding a pardon in it.</hi> 1 John 2. 12. <hi>I write unto you little children, becauſe your ſins are forgiven you for his names ſake;</hi> though children, though little children, yet pardoned children, and mark it, the cauſe of that pardon was common to them with the ſtronger men <hi>(viz. for his Names ſake)</hi> a man is not pardoned for the ſtrength of his faith, nor debarred of it for the weakneſſe of his faith, but both th'one and the other enjoys it for his Names ſake (that is) for <hi>Chriſts ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, obſerve it, that though weak and ſtrong faith may vary much in the manner and degree of the apprehenſion, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, or reading of the pardon, yet they both agree in the ſtrength, and in the latitude of pardon. The weak belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath as an effectual, and as ample, and full remiſſion as the ſtrongeſt believer; for Chriſt did not become an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal ſurety, or an uneven Sacrifice for ſinne; my meaning is this, that he did not only undertake the debts of ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but of every one; nor did he undertake ſome debts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſome beleevers, but all the debts of all beleevers. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 6 <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi> and Jer. 32. 8. <hi>I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have ſinned,</hi> which words extend to all beleevers, becauſe to all that are covenanted.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:115662:77"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, <hi>Juſtification by imputed righteouſneſſe.</hi> There is a common equal intereſt in this by all beleevers: It is but one garment for every beleever, it is an entire thing. One believer hath not one righteouſneſſe to juſtifie him, and another believer another, but all are juſtified by the ſame righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; neither is the imputation of this righteouſneſſe partial, or unequal, but alike to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>The righteouſneſſe of God without the Law is manifeſted, being witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>Even the righteouſneſſe of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that beleeve, for there is no difference.</hi> Therefore God is ſaid (in <hi>v.</hi> 26) <hi>the Juſtifier of him that beleeveth in Jeſus,</hi> if any man doth truely believe in Chriſt, God juſtifies that man, and Chriſt is made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe unto him, (that is) the Lord will reckon unto him the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, he will in Chriſt pronounce him juſt and acquit him.</p>
                  <p>The moſt <hi>elevated beleever</hi> cannot be preſented in a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way before Gods juſtice ſafely, in the <hi>ſtrength of his own perfections,</hi> and therefore hath no reaſon to glory or boaſt, and the moſt <hi>weak beleever</hi> is not excluded, but <hi>adorned with the robe of Christs compleat righteouſneſſe,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own <hi>manifold imperfections,</hi> and therefore hath no reaſon to be diſcouraged or diſmayed, for as much as <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to every one that believes,</hi> Rom. 10. 4.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the <hi>inheritance of glory,</hi> even thoſe weak Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> who were oft <hi>rebuked</hi> for their <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>doubtings,</hi> were commanded by Chriſt to <hi>rejoyce; becauſe their names were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we be <hi>Believers,</hi> we are ſonnes, and if ſonnes, then heirs; <hi>heires of life,</hi> and <hi>co-heires with Chriſt in glory,</hi> Rom. 8. 16, 17. Gal. 4. 26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Verſ. 29. <hi>And if ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> for eternal life is founded in Chriſt, God hath put all life in him, from him we draw our <hi>life of grace,</hi> and by him we poſſeſſe our <hi>life of glory.</hi> 1 John 5. 11. <hi>God hath given unto us eternal life, and this life</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:115662:77"/> 
                     <hi>is in his Sonne.</hi> Verſe 12. <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Yea, but who are they who <hi>have the Son?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> See <hi>ver</hi> 13. <hi>Theſe things I have written unto you, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Name of the Sonne of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, every believer is he who hath the Sonne, and by him that eternal life.</p>
                  <p>3. Every beleever hath vertual intereſt in Chriſt (that is) he ſhall partake of the vertues, and graces, and ſtrength of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The vertues of Chriſt are many; I will touch at ſome, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>crucifying vertue</hi> which ſubdues the love and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſinne, now every beleever ſhares in this, though one beleever be more troubled with the inſolent motions of ſinne, then another, yet no believer ſhall lie under the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi> Gal. 5. 24. <hi>And they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts.</hi> Every beleever is gathered under the <hi>rod</hi> and <hi>Scepter of Chriſt,</hi> and is made alive to Chriſt, and dead to ſinne, yea, and Chriſt will more and more mortifie his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart; He will be made death to the ſtrongeſt luſt in the weakeſt believer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An <hi>aſſiſting vertue,</hi> which aides the ſoul in matter of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſervice; now Chriſt will not only guide the ſtrong, but alſo lead the weak believer: He will ſend forth his <hi>enabling strength</hi> for all the ſervices which he requires, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>He ſaid unto me, my grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe; moſt gladly therefore will I glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, there was weakneſſe and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on <hi>Pauls</hi> part. but there was ſtrength and power on <hi>Chriſts</hi> part, and this ſtrength would Chriſt make to appear in <hi>Pauls</hi> weakneſſe (that is) though <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw and felt his own ſtrength inſufficient, yet he ſhould find Chriſt ſufficient, ſufficiently ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him in that particular. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>Likewiſe, the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:115662:78"/> 
                     <hi>us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> Mark that place, though we are very infirme, very weak to any holy duty, to prayer and the reſt, yet Chriſt will help, he will come in with his Spirit which ſhall enable us with ſupplications, ſo that even very weak believers may take comfort in this, that Chriſt will ſtrengthen and aide them by his Spirit in duties as well as the ſtrongeſt.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt believer cannot performe ſervice by <hi>his own ſtrength,</hi> and the <hi>weakeſt</hi> ſhall be <hi>inabled by Chriſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be three things which Chriſt will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to every believer, even to the weakeſt, about du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>One is, <hi>an affection and heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another is, <hi>ſtrength and aſſiſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt is, <hi>pardon and acceptance;</hi> what is amiſſe, and wanting, ſhall be pardoned, and what is imperfectly, and weakly good, ſhall yet through his interceſſion be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>His Father (for his merits) will <hi>not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Perſevering vertue,</hi> by which the ſoul comes at length to caſt Anchor and to be ſafely landed. Now the ſtrong faith hath (in a ſort) heaven already, yet weak faith ſhall alſo make a ſaving voyage: as it was with them in <hi>Pauls ſhipwrack,</hi> ſome of them could ſwim, and quickly, and better get to ſhore, others were more unskilful, and therefore laid hold and made uſe of broken boards, yet the text ſaith, <hi>That they all came ſafe to land:</hi> That I ſay of ſtrong and weak faith, though the ſtrong believer can better cut through the manifold oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, though he can riſe more eaſily above the waves of Satans temptations then the weak believer, yet both of them ſhall hold out to the end, and meet at heaven. You ſee ſeveral bottoms at ſea, one makes more ſpeed then another, and perhaps is better ordered; but thoſe duller and ſlower bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms follow after, and at length they come to the ſame Haven, and ſo caſt Anchor together.

                  <p>That <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Author,</hi> will alſo be the <hi>finiſher</hi> of all true faith, and though faith may be very weak, yet the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faith is invincible: <hi>The gates (no not) of hell</hi> (and they

                  <p>Againe, this is a ſweet comfort, that the weak believer ſhall hold out as well as the ſtrong, and that Chriſt is the Guardian of both; verily, that muſt needs be good which God gives, and that muſt needs be ſure which Chriſt keeps; the weakeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is held by a ſtrong hand, and is ſecured by an inſeparable arme.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Every beleever</hi> is in the ſame <hi>fundamental league with God,</hi> he is reconciled unto him, and hath a true (nay for ought I yet underſtand) an equal intereſt in his ſpecial love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: It is freely confeſſed, that the ſtrong believer hath more <note place="margin">Love.</note> ſenſible diſcoveries of the ſtreames, yet the weak believer is as deep in the fountaine.

                  <p>O how doth God condeſcend in his nature, in his Word, in his wayes, in his dealings, in his forbearances towards weak beleevers? how hath he prevented and anſwered all objections to their hands? all which ſhews his ſingular love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto them.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>weak beleever</hi> falls ſhort of that <hi>joy</hi> which the <hi>ſtrong beleever</hi> poſſeſſeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joy</hi> may be conſidered three wayes, either in its cauſe, which <note place="margin">Joy three ways conſidered.</note> is the <hi>love of God</hi> and the <hi>blood of Chriſt;</hi> or in its <hi>title</hi> and <hi>claim,</hi> which belongs to faith receiving Chriſt; or in its <hi>actual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> which depends upon a beleeving apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and perſwaſion. Now, though the weakeſt beleever hath
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115662:79"/> cauſe of great joy, for as the <hi>Angel</hi> ſpake to the ſhepherds, that may be ſaid to him, <hi>Fear not, for behold I bring you good tydings of great joy, for unto you is borne this day in the City of of David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord,</hi> Luke 2. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>And though he hath a true title to the ſweeteſt joy, for faith doth unite him to Chriſt, and Chriſt entitles him to joy, yet he hath, not ſuch an <hi>actual preſence of joy</hi> as the ſtrong beleever. Every faith is an hand, holding, but the ſtrong faith is the mouth, taſting that ſweet wine. He hath not ſuch full apprehenſions of his own ſtate, he doth not yet ſo clearly conceive of that great love and goodneſſe which God hath put in Chriſt for him; He hath not ſuch an evident view of his own particular intereſts in <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but is infinitely toſſed with doubtings and ſuſpitions, whether he may yet <hi>take Chriſt</hi> as his, whether he may <hi>own the promiſes</hi> of mercy, and <hi>appropriate the great loving kindneſſe of a Father.</hi> Now igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is apt to breed ſuſpitions, and doubts are apt to raiſe fears, both of which keeps off or under, actual joy: No man can well <hi>joy</hi> in a <hi>concealed</hi> good, or joy much in a <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned title:</hi> All the good which God hath firmly and largely made over unto me in his Sonne; it doth not affect my heart with gladneſſe and rejoycing, whiles I am in diſpute with it, and am rather apt to conclude, it is not for me, then that it is my portion. The ſtrong believer therefore hath this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the weak, he is more acquainted in particular about his good, and ſo his heart <hi>rejoyceth with joy unſpeakable and glorious, his ſoul doth rejoyce in God his Saviour,</hi> but the weak believer cannot yet ſee his pardon, yea often ſuſpects whether it ſhall be drawn or no: one is in a faire day, the other in a wet; It is day to both.</p>
                  <p>The matter is cleare to the ſtrong believer, and therefore his heart goes away rejoycing, the matter is doubtful to the weak beleever, and therefore his ſoule goes away weeping. One of them hath a good Chriſt, and a glad heart too, the other hath a good Chriſt, but yet a very heavy heart: His poſſeſſion is doubtful, and therefore his heart is ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The weak beleever</hi> hath not that <hi>ſweet peace</hi> that the <hi>ſtrong believer</hi> hath: where faith is weak there the conſcience is not throughly ſetled.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:115662:80"/>
                  <p> Peace in the conſcience is, as it were, the <hi>harmonious tuning of</hi>

                     <hi>the ſoul,</hi> it is a <hi>heavenly tranquility, a ſerenity, a gracious quieting and pacifying of the ſpirit of man, ſpringing from a perſwaſion of Gods love in Chriſt:</hi> Now, the weak faith hath ſtrong ſcruples, it hath many troubles, it is not ſure that all is right, and all is cleare. It may be, that God is my God, and it may be he is not; it may be Chriſt is mine, and perhaps not; it may be my ſins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it may be they are not; it may be that God is my friend, and reconciled, and it may be he is not. You know that the peace of a Chriſtian muſt be ſeen ratified in a double Court, or elſe the ſoul will not be quiet; One is in the Court of heaven, another is in the Court of conſcience; Nay, and the peace in this lower Court is not cleare til it comes from the higher Court; conſcience cannot be quiet till God be quiet, it cannot give teſtimony and diſcharge, untill God hath begun: If God hath not yet diſmiſſed the ſoul, if he holds up the caſe of a ſinful ſoul without releaſe, conſcience cannot acquit and free that ſoul: But weak faith ſees its ſuit and tryal yet depending in the high Court of heaven; a weak believer doth not yet ſee or know that God will aſſuredly pardon him, that God is reconciled to him, that God will indeed do good unto him, here are his doubts and fears, and therefore here are his troubles and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrong believer is like <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>I will both lay me down, and ſleep, for thou Lord only makeſt me dwell in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The weak believer is like <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 11. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou thus diſquietted within me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The one is like the Mother which hath the child in her armes, or at her breaſts, with many ſmiling delights and ſatieties; the other is like the mother now in labor, and travaile with the child which hath many bitter throwes and panges one ſucceeding the other: The one is like a man ſtanding upon a rock, where his foot ſtands unmoved and ſteady; but the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>her is like a man in a ſafe ſhip, upon unquiet waters, toſſed up and down: Weak faith is in a ſafe ſhip, (which is Chriſt) but toſſed upon vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of waves (which are our doubtings;) ſometimes faith and hope, anon faith and feare; ſometimes I may have confidence, anon I am caſt out of his ſight; now I will look up to God as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115662:80"/> mine in Chriſt, by and by, ſurely this is preſumption, God will not accept of me.</p>
                  <p>Such a ſtorme, and ſuch a calme is there in the weak believer, ſuch an unſetled ſetling: The day of his ſmall comforts doth eaſily ſit, and the night of many troubles abide long upon him. You ſhall ſeldome ſee a weak believer without a teare at his eye, a ſigh in his breaſt, and a fear in his heart, yet I fear all is not ſure, O that God would once aſſure me that he is my God! I know not what to do, or what to ſay, or what to think, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the <hi>hand writing yet blotted out,</hi> nor the <hi>heavens opening,</hi> and do you think there is any hope for me? Thus the weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. But ſtrong faith can anſwer many arguments, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold its evidence againſt many temptations: It can more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily place and ſtay the ſoul upon its reſt, it hath ſeen and taſted more then weak faith, it knows whom it hath truſted, and that he will be its God and guide for ever; that he hath pardoned tranſgreſſions, and will remember iniquity no more; where faith is great, there the war is ſtrong with ſin, and the love high to God, and the peace more large and ſetled in the conſcience.</p>
                  <p>The weak believer hath not that <hi>ſweetneſſe in communion with God</hi> as the <hi>ſtrong believer hath.</hi> Take him in the way of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or in the way of Duties; in both, his converſings with God, are more brackiſh and flat. When any threatning is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and applyed, his heart preſently miſgives him, may not this concerne me? and, I fear this is my portion. When any precepts and graces are revealed and differenced, he is uſually apt to charge <hi>want of them,</hi> or <hi>hypocriſie under them,</hi> upon himſelf, either I am not thus as God requires, or if ſo, yet not in truth.</p>
                  <p>When the Box of ointment is opened, I mean the <hi>blood of Chriſt,</hi> and the tender of rich mercy, and ſpacious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, yet the ſavour of them is mixt to his ſoul, he doth more diſpute his right, then can cloſe with their goodneſſe; yea, but how know I that I am intended? and anſwers, I am not ripe for ſuch conſolations, my wounds, have not bled ſufficiently, I am not fitted, I doubt I ſhould preſume, if I ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in <hi>matter of duty,</hi> here he hath not a ſweet communion <note place="margin">For duties.</note> with God neither. Sometimes ſo over-borne, that he thinks
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115662:81"/> it in vaine for him to pray or look up, and therefore is ready (in a fit of temptation) to lay aſide the work, yet he cannot but pray, but then the knee is bended with ſuch ſuſpitions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, perhaps this ſhall be but to harden me more, and God will not heare me; or if the ſoul can gather any degrees of better confidence, that it ſhall finde ſome grace, and acceptance, then inſtantly it queſtions all this, and <hi>ſuſpects</hi> even the <hi>very grants,</hi> and <hi>anſwers,</hi> as well as <hi>its own heart</hi> and petitions; conjecturing them to be rather, the <hi>deluding fancies of a deceitful heart,</hi> wiſhing well to it ſelf, then the <hi>ſincere reſolutions</hi> and <hi>ſatisfactions</hi> of a <hi>good and gracious God, who heareth prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus is the weak believer (for a long time) kept in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he cannot <hi>taſte the goodneſſe of God,</hi> which he deſires to embrace, nor reliſh thoſe promiſes which he deſires to apply; but in all communions with God, either dis-heartens his way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or diſplaceth his comforts afterwards, either he is not fit to pray or elſe not fit to enjoy, either he cannot <hi>deſire</hi> what is <hi>good,</hi> or elſe ſtill he is queſtioning what is true. So that oft-times, even the wayes of his own comfort, are uncomfortable to him, and the very <hi>method of peace,</hi> is his uſual <hi>trouble and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſons of all which may be,</p>
                  <p>Not only the <hi>nature of unbelief,</hi> which is an uncomforting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, and diſquieting impedient to the ſoul in all holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; But alſo the <hi>properties of this unbelief,</hi> cauſing the ſoul to look more on it ſelf then God, and raiſing more feares for preſent want, then hopes for aſſured and promiſed helpes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>limittings of God</hi> to preſent ſatisfaction, or elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, <hi>no intereſt in his favour</hi> and gracious intentions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, forgetting uſually the <hi>mediation</hi> and <hi>interceſſion of Chriſt,</hi> in whom alone the ſoule and petitions are worthy.</p>
                  <p>4. The <hi>weak believer</hi> hath not that <hi>ſuccesfulneſſe in communion with God</hi> as the ſtrong believer hath.</p>
                  <p>For all doubtings do prejudice our ſuits: There is not a more ſure and compendious way to non-ſuit our ſuits, then by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them out of an unbelieving heart: No faith may be ſure of denial, and he who delivers up his requeſts to God with an hand, and an hand, with an hand of faith, and a hand of doubting; either he hath a longer or elſe a ſhorteranſwer. <hi>According to thy</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:115662:81"/> 
                     <hi>faith be it unto thee,</hi> ſaid Chriſt; ſtrong faith brings God much glory, and doth fetch in much good to the ſoul, but the leſſer faith, the leſſer good; as according to the largeneſſe of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or ſtrength of the hand, &amp;c. The higher the Sun is, the more light is in the Horizon, ſo the greater the faith is in our requeſts, the ſooner and the larger ſhall be our promiſed anſwers. You remember what <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Joaſh King of Iſrael, take the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes</hi> and he <hi>took them,</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>ſmite upon the ground,</hi> and he <hi>ſmote thrice, and ſtayed.</hi> And <hi>the man of God was wrath with him,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>thou ſhouldſt have ſmitten five or ſix times, then hadſt</hi>

                     <hi>thou ſmitten Syria till thou hadst conſumed it, whereas now thou ſhalt ſmite Syria but thrice. Prayer</hi> is the <hi>arrow of the ſoul,</hi> it is the ſwift meſſenger ſent up to heaven, and <hi>faith</hi> is the <hi>hand</hi> which diſpatcheth it, now according to the <hi>ſtrength of faith</hi> is the <hi>greatneſſe of prayer in ſucceſſe.</hi> Thou didſt pray (though) with much weakneſſe of faith, and haſt got a little comfort, why didſt thou not ſmite the ground ſix times? why didſt thou not double thy ſtrength in believing thou ſhouldſt then have had comfort? like a river, whereas now thou haſt only the ſmaller drops. Thou haſt prayed, (though) with much weakneſſe of faith, and haſt got a little power over thy ſinful and rebellious heart, why didſt not thou ſmite the ground ſix times? why didſt thou not abound in more believing? for then thou ſhouldſt have had a fuller victory over thy corrupt luſts and inclinations. Herein hath <hi>ſtrong faith</hi> the preeminence of <hi>weak</hi> that the one hath not that full ſpeed at heaven as the other; not that God will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the faith that is weak, but that its anſwers are not ſo full, becauſe it is accompanied with doubtings. This we finde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally, that our helpes (much of them) yet ſtick behinde in heaven, and our corruptions (much of them) yet inſult below in our hearts, not that we do not hate them, not that we do not pray againſt them, but becauſe our faith is new or weak, we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think that God will not help, then that he will indeed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer or do us good.</p>
                  <p>5. The weak believer is more under the power of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then the ſtrong. My meaning is this, that his heart is more apt to ſink, and faile, and perplex, and diſquiet him in the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of outward things; a croſſe cannot come but he ſtartles, and if the affliction be cloſe, he can hardly hold up: if he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115662:82"/> hath not ſome friends to ſmooth and cheriſh him, ſome calme eſtate to maintaine and uphold him: If the tyde comes not in, if the winde doth not blow, if the <hi>fig-tree doth not bloſſome,</hi> if God puts him upon an unuſual way, if he toucheth him in his Name, eaſe, advantage, any neer outward ſupport, if the croſſe be long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now <hi>I am caſt off, I ſhall periſh, what ſhall I eate, what ſhall I drink, what ſhall I put on?</hi> we and ours are undone, <hi>there's none cares for my body,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpake <hi>for his ſoule.</hi> The heart gathers into many agonies, many prognoſtications, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny challenges of God, many impatient vexations, perhaps <hi>murmurings,</hi> repinings, and diſcontents, and diſtempers; yea, and hath ſometimes vile and inglorious thoughts of the <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſs of ſerving God, &amp;c.</hi> I think there is ſcarce any one of theſe, which the weak believer doth not ſenſibly feel in the times of his ſtraits and exigences, (which may exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humble and abaſe his ſoul therefore:) But the <hi>ſtrong beleever</hi> is a better Sea-man, his ſoul is more quiet in the <hi>abſence,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more looſened by faith in the <hi>preſence of the creature.

                  <p>By a <hi>bearing, and fruitful heart and life,</hi> John 15. 8.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>thankful praiſes and acknowledgements,</hi> Pſal. 50. 23.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>weak believer</hi> he doth not <hi>acquit God</hi> ſo in his <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;</hi> It is often with him, <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? will he be gracious, or will he be favourable no more? or if thou wilt thou canſt</hi> do this for me: It doth not ſo clearly juſtifie God in the greatneſſe of his power, in the readineſſe of his mercy, in the immutability of his truth.</p>
                  <p>He is not ſo <hi>fruitful:</hi> for where the root is weak, there the branches are not ſo ſtrong, or full; <hi>the fruitfulneſſe of the heart</hi> conſiſts in the rich increaſe of all graces, and in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged heavenlineſſe of the affections, and the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the life depends upon the inward inriching of the heart, as the ſtreames on the Spring, or the beames on the Sun, and the fruitfulneſſe of both depends upon the richneſſe of faith.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>habits of grace</hi> depends immediately on <hi>Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and not on faith, yet the <hi>meaſures of grace</hi> depend (inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally) very much <hi>on faith,</hi> it being the Conduit pipe, that which draws <hi>grace</hi> for <hi>grace</hi> from Chriſt. A weak believer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have ſuch a ſtrength of affection, nor vigor of actions as the ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>He is not ſo <hi>thankful;</hi> you ſhall for ever finde this to be true, that what is a weakening to faith, that is a leſſening to thanks. No mans tongue is more in praiſe then he whoſe heart is filled with perſwaſion: God hath but cold thanks from him, who is yet diſputing and queſtioning his receipts; where the mercy is fully cleared, there the heart is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlarged: But till the ſoul ſees it ſelf indeed a <hi>debter,</hi> it will prove but an ill and <hi>ſlow pay-maſter;</hi> How can I fully thank God, that he hath expreſſed that <hi>Mirandum</hi> of love, to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115662:83"/> give Chriſt to me, when yet I do in my ſoul ſuſpect and queſtion whether this be ſo or no?</p>
                  <p>How can I fully bleſſe and praiſe God for his rich mercy in the pardon of my ſinnes, whiles my ſoul doth yet ſuſpect that the book is uncroſſed, and the controverſie of guilt is not yet taken up 'twixt God and me? But where faith is ſtrong, there <hi>praiſe is great;</hi> when the Moon is fulleſt of light, then the tydes are higher in their returnes; ſo the more clear apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods love to us in Chriſt even raiſeth affections to a greater flow of thankful retributions. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 1. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord O my ſoul, and all that is within me bleſſe his holy Name.</hi> Ver. 2. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits;</hi> See how he chargeth and rechargeth his ſoul to praiſe; but why? <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>Who crowneth thee with loving kindneſſe and mercies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. The <hi>weak Beleever</hi> will be more <hi>puzled to die</hi> then the ſtrong believer. It is with the ſtrong believer as with <hi>Simeon,</hi> who <hi>held Chriſt in his armes, Now</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation:</hi> He may eaſily deſire death to let him out of a miſerable world, who hath aſſuredly got, and hath Chriſt, the Authour of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life. Or as with <hi>Paul,</hi> having <hi>a deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt, which is far better,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1. <hi>We know if our earthly houſe, &amp;c. we have a building of God.</hi> For the ſtrong belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knows, that <hi>Chriſt is to him in life and death advantage;</hi> By him we ſhall go to the God of all mercies, and to the <hi>Father of all conſolations.</hi> He ſhall go to that manſion which his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath provided, and there have a <hi>glorious union with God,</hi> and <hi>ſociety with Saints for ever.</hi> But the <hi>weak beleever</hi> will perhaps ſtagger, and his heart will divide it ſelf; I would not yet die, if I muſt, what ſhall I do? Chriſt is he whom I have loved and ſerved, but I am not ſure that he is mine; Heavenly glory is the wages for our ſervice, but I am not ſure that I ſhall go into it, matters are yet doubtful, and my heart is yet fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I know not whether ſuch ſinnes are yet taken off, and how will God look upon me if I die, of whoſe loving favour I have not been aſſured, whiles I have lived? I hope the beſt, and yet I ſee cauſe to fear; death may do me good, yet I had rather live to clear accounts 'twixt God and my ſoul, that ſo then I might give up, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:115662:83"/>
                  <p> 8. The <hi>weak beleever</hi> hath not ſuch <hi>cheerful expectations,</hi> nor <hi>quiet ſubmiſſions</hi> as the ſtrong believer.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrong believer is at it as the Church in <hi>Micah, My God will hear me,</hi> and if he denies a particular good, yet he can ſit down and ſing; when he is going to prayer he chears up his heart with a confidence on God, and when he findes God determining and revealing his will, there he bleſſeth God, and follows his calling. But the weak believer is apt to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal a mercy, he cannot ſee a plain way for his grant, nor an eaſily quiet heart after his denial.</p>
                  <p>9. The <hi>efficacy of temptations</hi> doth more <hi>intangle the weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever</hi> then the ſtrong, like the weaker veſſel at ſea amidſt the greater waves; Satan doth couſen his ſoul with eaſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and anon diſrobes him of his comforts like a lewd ſubtile enemy, he forceth the weak believer often to try and clear his title, and increaſeth miſtakes in all paſſages 'twixt God and the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If he doth <hi>caſt himſelf on mercy,</hi> then it is preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; If he holds off, then it is infidelity and rejecting of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If he <hi>doubts,</hi> then it is <hi>deſpaire</hi> and a forſaking of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If he <hi>ſinnes,</hi> then it is unpardonable, becauſe ſince know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and mercy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If he findes <hi>distractions in dutie,</hi> then this is hypocriſie in the heart.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If he <hi>meets with helliſh ſuggestions</hi> (of which Satan is only the Author) O then, <hi>who could be in Chriſt</hi> and have ſuch <hi>abominable thoughts!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. If the Ordinances do not preſently comfort, O then, they are ſealed up, and there is no faith, elſe the Word would profit.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If every corruption be not ſubdued in <hi>every degree</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> O then, <hi>vertue is not gone from Chriſt,</hi> the heart is ſtill nought, and the faith unſound.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If not the <hi>ſame constant tenor of ſmart affections,</hi> why then, there was never any <hi>true love of God,</hi> no reverence of him now, nor fear, nor duties, but the ſoul is <hi>dead,</hi> utterly hardened, and God hath no pleaſure in it.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:115662:84"/> 9. If God doth <hi>anſwer the ſoul,</hi> yea, but that is but an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. If he doth <hi>not anſwer,</hi> why? then it is cleare that <hi>God</hi> neither <hi>doth,</hi> nor <hi>will ever regard you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. If I do not <hi>go to the Sacrament,</hi> why? then thou <hi>ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>his blood:</hi> If I go and <hi>come away with tears,</hi> O then thou <hi>waſt unbeleeving,</hi> or elſe thou hadſt been ſent away with joy and increaſe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. If I do not <hi>put on for grace,</hi> then thou art wicked: If I <hi>do put on for grace,</hi> then thou art ſo wicked that <hi>God will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it on thee.</hi> Thus doth Satan involve, and diſtreſſe, and ſet the ſoul of a weak Believer (like a man at cheſſe) forward and backward; he makes him to ſuſpect every mercy; and every grace, and every affection, and every duty, and every promiſe, and every Ordinance; ſo <hi>violently</hi> doth he <hi>toſſe,</hi> though he cannot <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſink</hi> the heart of a weak believer.</p>

                  <p>Another is <hi>Poſitive,</hi> which is incident unto us Chriſtians, to whom the arm of the Lord is revealed; Chriſt is manifeſted as the body of the Sun by the beams of light, ſo he by the brightneſſe and evidence of the Goſpel, and yet the ſoule knows him not, receives him not, doth not take him both as <hi>Lord and Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this there are ſeveral degrees, and all of them fearfully dangerous, to ſpeak the truth plainly, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. A <hi>refuſing of his Articles and Covenants,</hi> which is a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and vile diſliking of thoſe tearms upon which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf to be ours: we would bring him to termes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with ſinne, or the creature; we would abridge his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <hi>Lordly Scepter,</hi> like what we pleaſe, do what we liſt, have <hi>him</hi> to be <hi>our Saviour,</hi> and <hi>ſinne</hi> to be our <hi>Ruler,</hi> we would beſtow our <hi>ſafeties on him,</hi> and our <hi>ſervices</hi> upon the <hi>world,</hi> we will not freely and <hi>fully conſent</hi> to all that he is, nor <hi>ſubmit to all that he propoſeth,</hi> or may befall us with him and for him: And ſo like the vaine <hi>Merchant,</hi> we <hi>miſſe the pearle,</hi> becauſe we will <hi>not go to the price:</hi> We enjoy our ſelves ſtill, and our ſinnes, and our world too, but we <hi>forſake our mercies for lying vanities,</hi> the <hi>ſoul</hi> is <hi>Chriſtleſſe</hi> ſtill, becauſe thus ſordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>unbeleeving.</hi>

                  <p>It is not the <hi>confidence</hi> which thou mayeſt put upon the <hi>faith of another,</hi> which will do it: as every mans ſoul is for his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo every mans faith is for his own ſoul; the wiſe virgins had no more oile then would ſerve their own Lamps; and no mans faith is more then enough for himſelf: Though Chriſt can ſave many, yet faith ſaves him only who hath it.</p>
                  <p>It is not the confidence of a naked decree which will do it, if God hath decreed to ſave me, I ſhall be ſaved; O no his decrees are his own ſecret wayes, and the way which he hath opened to us, is to get <hi>faith</hi> and to <hi>believe in his Son.</hi>

                  <p>There is guilt, much guilt lying upon thy ſoul, and who is the Prieſt to ſuffer, to offer, to ſatisfie, to take away tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but Chriſt? None can blot out the guilt of ſin for us, but he who had not a ſpot of ſin in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>There is filth, much filth defiling our natures, poyſoning our actions, and who is the Prophet to enlighten, to teach, to change, to cleanſe from ſinfulneſſe but Chriſt?

                  </p>
                  <p>There is dominion, much dominion of ſin, preſcribing a <hi>Law to our members,</hi> ſending out all inſolent inclinations, holding us

                     <hi>me that I may not be baptized?</hi> ſo you may ſay, why? her is <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſet out to the life, here are arguments faire enough to draw on my ſoul, what hinders that we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and receive Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> After all theſe diſcoveries, yet the heart ſtands off, and why? becauſe there are yet many cords with which the ſoul is held, there are yet ſeveral impediments which do intangle and ſeduce the heart, which keeps it down from mounting and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up to the Lord of life, againſt which we muſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour if ever we would beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I will touch ſome of the choiſeſt of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One impediment to faith is that <hi>natural Atheiſme</hi> in the ſons of men. You know that as in the concoction or digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of meats, that which is a prejudice to the firſt concoction or digeſtion of meats, is a hindrance to the two other, and as in points of demonſtration, that ſcruple which weakens the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the truth of the principle, it ever diſable the ſtrength of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſſent to the deduced concluſion. So is it in divinity, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever vile quality in the ſoul prejudiceth the reverent reſpects o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the moſt common and <hi>firſt truths,</hi> it doth hinder it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the embracing of the <hi>depending truths,</hi> which receive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> authority and ſtrength from the grants of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> it is a ſlighting <hi>quarrel with the firſt truths:</hi> Atheiſtical ſpirit, it hath moſt ſordid and looſe concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115662:90"/> of God and of his Word; it doth not ſet up God in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his nature, and Majeſty of his Attributes, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Word; God looks not like a God unto him; nor doth the Word of God work upon him like the Word of God. <hi>God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> he doth not really conceive of him, as one who indeed is omnipotent, and ſo holy, and ſo juſt, and ſo merciful as he reveales himſelf: Thoſe ſweet truths of favour, and kindneſſe, and mercy, and the blood of Chriſt, they are either nothing to him, or as empty notions. Thoſe ſharp threatnings againſt an unbelieving perſon, with condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and wrath, and hell, they are as terrible fables and ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowes to him; He doth not believe any ſuch diſpleaſures, nor torments, that thus it ſhall be indeed. Now how can the ſoul be inclined to believe in Chriſt, to part with its deare luſts, with its worldly advantages and pleaſures, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it ſelfe to the Lawes and Scepter of Chriſt, when as it doth expreſſely or vertually deny the nature of God, and the power of his truths?</p>
                  <p>Didſt thou indeed beleeve that <hi>there was a God,</hi> didſt thou indeed believe that his revelations of mans ſinful miſery, and of his ſingular mercy in Chriſt were true and real? Didſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God hath wrath, and blackneſſe of darkneſs, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of vengeance for ever to be poured on the unbeliever, and that the lake which burnes with fire and brimſtone muſt be thy aſſured portion, (as God hath ſpoken?) how couldſt thou ſit ſtill, content thy heart, neglect thy ſalvation by Chriſt, ſtand off from the wayes and endeavours for faith?</p>
                  <p>Therefore to remove this impediment, beg of <hi>God to forgive,</hi> and <hi>cure the Atheiſme of thy Spirit.</hi> Strive to ſet up the <hi>true God</hi> in thy underſtanding, and to believe that he <hi>is the Lord who will not lye.</hi> Whatſoever he hath revealed himſelf to be and to do. Why, that he is, and that he will performe; that it is thy duty to return from ſinne to him in Chriſt, and if thou doſt returne, he will in mercy ſpare and <hi>deliver thy ſoul from the pit, becauſe he hath found a ranſome;</hi> but if thou wilt not return, he wil bathe the ſword of his flaming juſtice for ever in the blood of thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond impediment to the getting of faith is <hi>groſſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:115662:91"/> Whatſoever is contrary to knowledge, that ſame is contrary to faith; for though faith ſees not its ground in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon, yet it muſt have divine evidence to ſhew it its object, and way, and cauſes, or elſe it cannot be wrought in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>The ſoul muſt have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>light</hi> for all its <hi>apprehenſive operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> for the <hi>eye</hi> to ſee, and the <hi>underſtanding</hi> to perceive, and for the <hi>heart</hi> to embrace.</p>
                  <p>Now this is it which keeps men off from beleeving, they are <hi>extreamly ignorant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, of their own <hi>ſinful condition,</hi> they do not know their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nativity and conception what ſin is, nor what belongs to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>w abominable and vile their natures are, without all good, and like: a fountaine full of all wickedneſſe; how <hi>dead in treſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſſes and ſins;</hi> how totally defiled; from the <hi>crown of the head to the ſole of the foot;</hi> How perpetually rebellious againſt every precept of heaven, and how ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ghting of the tenders of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>of Gods juſt diſpoſition towards the ſinful perſon.</hi> They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſee him not armed, and ſetting out againſt them in all the <hi>threatnings</hi> and <hi>curſes of his Law;</hi> as <hi>Balaam</hi> in his paſſage, he adventured on, for <hi>he ſaw not the Angel of the Lord with a ſword in his hand</hi> ready to cleave him aſunder. So men reſt ſecurely in their natural ſtate; talk what you will of Chriſt, and of God, and of ſinne, and of faith, they are not moved, they know not the fearful iſſues of a natural and unbeleeving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they know not that God will judge them and condemn them for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of the <hi>excellencies of Chriſt</hi> what he is, whither God, or man, or both, even as it pleaſeth him, but favourly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> what he is in reſpect of his Natures, in reſpect of his Offices, in reſpect of his Actions, in reſpect of his Paſſion, in reſpect of his Benefits in reſpect of his Vertues, they underſtand not theſe things. How God hath manifeſted love in Chriſt, how Chriſt manifeſted love to them to what end he was made man, why Miniſters preach him ſo much, what is more in him then in any other; Alas they think not of theſe things, they know them not. Now brethren, how is it poſſible for the ſoul to believe, or to be perſwaded to believe in Chriſt, or to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115662:91"/> labour for this <hi>precious faith</hi> which is a ſtranger to it ſelf, to God, to Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Didſt thou indeed know thy condition to be the <hi>condition of death,</hi> wouldeſt thou not make out for the <hi>Lord of life?</hi> didſt thou indeed know thy condition to be the <hi>condition of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> wouldeſt thou not ſtrive to get unto the <hi>Prince of peace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So againe, as Chriſt ſpake to the woman, <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith unto thee; give me to drink, thou wouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water,</hi> John 4. 10. O if men did know what a <hi>gift Chriſt</hi> was; If heaven and earth, men and Angels had ſtudyed the helps of a poore ſinner, they could never have imagined ſuch a remedy as God found in giving his own Sonne; Now, if men did know him aright, what a Redeemer, what a Lord he is, what <hi>living water is in him.</hi> That in him only there is <hi>life</hi> for the <hi>dead, recovery</hi> for the <hi>ſinner, ſatisfaction</hi> for <hi>guilt, ſanctification</hi> for the <hi>ſoul, atonement</hi> for <hi>treſpaſſes, comfort</hi> for <hi>diſtreſſes, balme</hi> for <hi>wounds,</hi> ſalvation for their perſons: Why? how could it be but that they ſhould ask of him for a <hi>drop</hi> (at leaſt) <hi>of water,</hi> for ſome <hi>faith</hi> to receive him who is the <hi>fountain of grace and life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. A third impediment to the endeavours for faith, is a <hi>vain confidence of natural righteouſneſſe:</hi> This was it which kept off many of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the Text ſaith. <hi>That they truſted to their own righteouſneſſe.</hi> Yea, this is called the <hi>ſtumbling of the Jewes,</hi> it caſt them flat, that they doted ſo on legal abilities. When a baſe heart hath proud imaginations of Chriſt, and peace, and ſafety from ſomething within it ſelf, why? It will never look after Chriſt. A proud perſon who hath mony in his houſe, he ſcornes to be beholding to his neighbour; the proud ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who conceives that all is well 'twixt him and God, and that he hath done no man wrong, and none can ſay black is his eye, he is neither whore not thief, and his heart is as good as the beſt, and his meanings are alwayes honeſt, and none can tax him for injuſtice, and he hath kept all Gods Commandments as well as ever he could, and he hath had a good belief, (he thanks God) ever ſince he was borne. I tell you ſuch a perſon will not be beholding to God for Chriſt, for he (in his opinion) being ſo <hi>whole, needs not the</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:115662:92"/> 
                     <hi>Phyſician</hi> neither ſhall you perſwade him to <hi>mourn</hi> for his ſinnes, or to <hi>repent,</hi> and to <hi>part with all for Chriſt, to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> and all his own vaine confidences, and to put himſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Jeſus Chriſt; he truſts to be ſaved by his good deeds, and by his good meanings.</p>
                  <p>Ah fooliſh and ſeduced ſoul! Who hath <hi>bewitched thee to forſake thine own mercies?</hi> Thinkeſt thou that God would have ſent his onely Sonne, and to poure out his own ſoule for ſinners, if that yet there had been ability in ſinful man to have purchaſed his own ſafety and happineſſe? And doeſt thou ſee no ſinne in thy ſelf, which may therefore for ever thruſt thee off from reſting upon thy ſelfe? and are thy works ſuch abſolute bottomes and foundations, when the <hi>Heathens</hi> can match them and exceed them? or cannot God eſpy a flaw in thy Ship, and much falſe conveyance in thy title, and much defect in thy deeds, who can <hi>charge folly upon the Angels?</hi> And are thy meanings and works ſo good, while thy heart is yet ſo ignorant, thy life yet ſo prophane? Can what thou doeſt finde acceptance or merit, when yet thou truſteſt not on him who only is the <hi>merit for a ſinner?</hi> Thinkeſt thou thy meanings can be good, which diſhonour the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>freeneſſe of mercy;</hi> O no my brethren, the ſoul is the paſſenger, graces are the ſailes, the Spirit is the wind, but Chriſt, only Chriſt is the bottom which carries all ſafe and ſure to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Nay, if thou canſt ſee a Saviour in thy own good meanings; if a Saviour in thy own good works, a Saviour in any part or degree of inherent righteouſneſſe, either inward, for the change of nature, or outward for the emprovement of life; this, this will keep thee and Chriſt aſunder. No man will labour for <hi>faith in Chriſt,</hi> who hath a <hi>faith in himſelfe</hi> already as his own Saviour. Therefore as they in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, burned their books when they came to believe in Chhiſt,</hi> ſo muſt we unbottom our <hi>ſelves</hi> of our <hi>ſelves. Renounce</hi> our <hi>menſtrous rags, abhor our ſelves in duſt and aſhes,</hi> lay flat before the mercy-ſeat, cry out with the <hi>Leper, I am uncleane, unclean;</hi> with <hi>Daniel, To us belongs nothing but confuſion, for we have ſinned;</hi> with <hi>David, enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh righteous be justified;</hi> with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115662:92"/> the <hi>Publican</hi> ſtand afar off and ſay, <hi>Lord be merciful to me a ſinner;</hi> with <hi>Paul, I count all things but as dung and droſſe in compariſon of Chriſt,</hi> and, <hi>I deſire to be foundin him, not having my own righteouſneſſe, but that which is of faith,</hi> with thoſe <hi>Elders, cast</hi> (if we had them) <hi>our very crowns</hi> to the earth before the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and ſay <hi>he only is worthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If ever thou wouldeſt get to <hi>believe in Chriſt,</hi> labour to get <note place="margin">Do not ſtand in thy own light.</note> the mountaines to be <hi>levelled,</hi> the <hi>high imaginations</hi> to be <hi>caſt down,</hi> to caſt <hi>thy ſelf</hi> out <hi>of thy ſelf:</hi> There is nothing that I have been, or have done, or do, or can do, which I can truſt to; <hi>I ſeek for the living among the dead,</hi> whiles I look for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in my ſelf. He is farre enough from ſafety, who reſts on the <hi>arme of his fleſh,</hi> and we ſhall never cloſe with, or <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Christs righteouſneſſe,</hi> until we can (in matter of merit or juſtification) <hi>deny our own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. A fourth impediment to beleeving is, the <hi>league of the heart with ſinne: Light is come into the world, but men love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe rather then light,</hi> John 3. 19. <hi>Sinne</hi> abſolutely doth not prejudice the contract of the ſoule with Chriſt, for Chriſt doth not negotiate for any ſoul, but the ſinful ſoul; He doth not come to a perſon, and ſay, if thou haſt no ſinne, I will beſtow my ſelf on thee, or if thou haſt not committed ſinne, I will be a redeemer, a Saviour unto thee. O no, the <hi>offer of Christ</hi> is only <hi>to the ſinner,</hi> and it is none but the ſinner who is to beleeve in Chriſt. But that which hinders the contract 'twixtt men and Chriſt, it is the <hi>love of ſin:</hi> Chriſt comes in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel unto us, and reports unto us our <hi>own exceeding ſinfulneſſe,</hi> and then <hi>his exceeding graciouſneſſe,</hi> and invites the ſoul (by many ſweet and tender arguments) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him, to be Lord and Chriſt, and aſſures it of pardon, and righteouſneſſe and ſalvation. Now ſaith Chriſt, that which I require of you is this, leave but your ſinnes, your ſinnes which will damne you, and I will be yours. Why? ſaith the ſoul, this is but reaſon, and I will hearken to it, well then ſaith Chriſt, go and quit ſuch a luſt, thy uncleanneſſe, or thy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath breaking, or thy drunkenneſſe, or thy lewd ſociety, &amp;c. Why, now the baſe and fooliſh heart falls off, I cannot live without my nature, I muſt and will be allowed in ſuch a courſe; The heart riſeth up, O, <hi>Benjamine</hi> ſhall not go, nay any thing but
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115662:93"/> this luſt. I will never be divorced from it, if I may have Chriſt and this ſinne too, well and good. Thus the love of ſinne ſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </head>
                  <p>NOW I come to direct you unto the uſe of ſuch meanes by which God workes this ſaving faith in the hearts of men.</p>
                  <p>Where, premiſe with me ſome particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is no <hi>natural power in man to produce</hi> a cauſe within himſelf; <hi>This great grace of faith</hi> is no fruit of the wiſdome of the fleſh, nor is it the <hi>birth of a corrupt will,</hi> if it were poſſible for a natural heart to ſee all the excellencies of Chriſt, if it were poſſible for him to draw out and behold all the arguments of Scripture, yet could he not by his own ſtrength make his own heart to believe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>immediate and ſole cauſe of faith is the Spirit of God:</hi> He
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115662:94"/> it is who is <hi>greater then the heart,</hi> and who can perſwade, and draw the heart, and who can change and renew the ſpirit, which till it be renewed by him, will never be moved to beleeve in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are <hi>meanes appointed by God,</hi> and which God doth ordinarily bleſſe, for the production of faith; as he hath ordained meanes, for the revelation of Chriſt, ſo he hath likewiſe conſecrated meanes, to lead the ſoul unto him, to implant faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now the <hi>great and ordinary meanes</hi> by which <hi>God workes faith</hi> in the hearts of men (I ſpeak of ſuch as are come to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of years) is the <hi>preaching of the Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. <hi>When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the Word of the Lord, and as many as were ordeined to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life believed,</hi> Rom. 10. 17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Eph. 1. 13. <hi>In whom ye alſo truſted after that ye heard the Word of truth, the Goſpel of your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Word is the Miniſterial inſtrument,</hi> which God uſeth to beget faith in Chriſt, may thus appeare.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is that which <hi>diſcovers unto the ſoul its extreame miſery and great need of Chriſt;</hi> nothing quickens the conſcience to that <hi>reflexive evidence,</hi> to the cleare and true ſight of the natural ſtate, which pricks the ſoul, which in a ſort compels the ſoul to look after the Redeemer of the world, as the Word doth. You ſee it hath been thus formerly, that when men have heard it, it hath unfolded their ſtate unto them, it hath broken all their proud imaginations, it hath driven them to their feet, it hath made them to cry out, <hi>men and brethren what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, and we find it in experience to be ſo, that the preaching of the Word, it opens the eyes of ſinners, it frames in them the ſenſe of ſinfulneſſe, and accurſedneſſe, it makes them indeed to feel the need of a Phyſician of ſuch an one as Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is that which diſcovers a <hi>ſhare for a broken ſhip;</hi> which doth reveale, and proclaime to poor ſinners Articles of peace in Chriſt; it makes known the great love of God and Chriſt, and how that Chriſt is the Sonne of God, and was ſent by God, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115662:95"/> ſatisfied for ſinners, and this was <hi>accepted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It makes the ſoul to confeſſe thoſe <hi>things as moſt true and good in themſelves:</hi> It convinceth a man, that of a truth God meanes graciouſly to men, that his Sonne was a Sacrifice, was a propitiation, that he did purchaſe pardon and ſalvation for ſinners.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is that which caſteth down <hi>all the reaſonings, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is that which <hi>clears the way for the ſoul againſt all its feares</hi> and unbeleeving doubts, from the freeneſſe of Gods mercy, from the fulneſſe of Chriſts redemption, from the willingneſſe on Chriſts part, and requeſts unto us to accept of him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is that which doth powerfully renew the diſpoſition of the underſtanding and will, and ſo incline them to <hi>eſteeme</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>higheſt truth,</hi> and to bend after him as the <hi>chiefeſt good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is that which ſtirres up the heart with a <hi>choice of Chriſt,</hi> and reſolution to have him what ever may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is that which makes the heart to <hi>cry ſervently to the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>work his bleſſed grace of faith:</hi> Yea, which draws out of us ſtrong ſupplications with many teares and longings, and to implead all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of making <hi>mercy</hi> good, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> good, and <hi>faith</hi> good unto us.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It is that which eſtabliſheth the ſoul to a <hi>patient expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for ever to lie at the <hi>poole,</hi> for ever to attend the <hi>doors of the Sanctuary,</hi> till the ſoul can take and cloſe with Chriſt by true beleeving.</p>
                  <p>But then to open unto you the way more diſtinctly, I would commend this courſe unto a perſon, that he may at length get a believing heart.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Study thy natural condition throughly:</hi> The right ſenſe of this, <note place="margin">8. Things.</note> though it doth not forma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now there are three things to convince our ſelves of, about our natural condition, I meane the ſtate without Chriſt.</p>

                     <hi>abhors</hi> and <hi>hates it.</hi> For it is compounded of nothing, but <hi>want of good,</hi> and <hi>inclination to evil</hi> to all that is oppoſite to God and holineſſe: That thou art in it, <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>blinde,</hi> and <hi>miſerable,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> an ignorant, oppoſing, unconceiving creature of any ſpiritual good, proud, and ſenſual, and vain, and earthly, loathſom and dead.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>ſure and fearful miſery of it:</hi> Thou art <hi>without</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>God, without Chriſt, without the Covenant,</hi> not a drop of mercy for thee, whiles thou remain'ſt thus; but all the wrath of God is againſt thee, and thou art under the dominion of ſinne, and terrible curſe of the Law, all the threatnings in the book of God are ever ready to ſeaſe on thee, and how ſoon may they arreſt thee, if God gives them commiſſion?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>utter inſufficiency to deliver thy ſelf out of this ſtate:</hi> Thou art never able to merit the leaſt mercy, nor to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> anſwer the great juſtice of God; Though thou ſhouldeſt <hi>offer thouſands of lambs, and ten thouſand rivers of oyle;</hi> thou art ſo totally broken in thy ſtrength, that thou canſt not pay a farthing, and never canſt thou be a Redeemer to thy ſelf, from thy ſins, or Gods juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Now drive and faſten theſe things as real and experimental truths into thy heart, till thou art <hi>ſhut up under ſinne,</hi> as the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115662:96"/> Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. (that is) ſo convinced on all ſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thy <hi>natural ſelf,</hi> that thou art faine to fall down and cry out, <hi>O Lord, I am unclean, I am uncleane,</hi> I am uncleane, a miſerable wretch, a loſt perſon for ever, unleſſe thou ſhew great compaſſion to my poor ſoul; This condition is deadly and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, I am full of ſinne and without ſtrength; and this condition is ſo fearful, that verily I will not reſt in it, <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall I do to be ſaved? Is there no balm in Gilead</hi> for a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul? no <hi>City of refuge</hi> for a diſtreſſed ſinner? no <hi>Rock of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> for a ſhipwrackt perſon? no hope of ſalvation yet left for me?</p>
                  <p>2. Then <hi>ſtudy the hope; of a ſinful ſoul.</hi> Why; though thou haſt been very wicked, and haſt exceeded in tranſgreſſions, yet there may be hope. The <hi>Goſpel;</hi> it is the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ape of good hope,</hi> it is that which thruſts out ſome ſight of land to a toſſed ſinner; It is a meſſage from heaven, proclaiming both the hope and poſſibility, and alſo the way and method of ſalvation for a ſinful perſon: Look, as the Law points out a way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for a righteous and innocent man, ſo the Goſpel doth for an offending and ſinful man. Therefore ſtudy it much, take ſome accurate paines to be throughly and really informemed and convinced, what Gods diſpoſitions are therein revealed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Now here are two things which I would commend.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is <hi>the study of Chriſt:</hi> Study him all over, perhaps thou mayeſt ſee that in him, which may anſwer many, yea all thy feares, Perhaps thou mayeſt ſee ſo much in him as may win much upon thy heart, to come in and accept of him by faith.</p>
                  <p>Therefore peruſe him well. Firſt, that he is <hi>God and man,</hi> and as ſo, a Mediator, and becauſe ſo, therefore an Almighty, and a <hi>compaſſionate Redeemer.</hi> Secondly, that it proceeds from the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>Counſel of God to give him to be the Saviour of ſinners:</hi> God did ſee the fallen ſtate and great miſery of men, and his abſolute inſufficiency to recover himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own love moved him to give his <hi>own Sonne</hi> in whom he did ordain the ſalvation of ſinners. Thirdly, that <hi>Chriſt was willing to become a Mediator,</hi> yea, he did freely give his life to make peace and procure ſalvation; and this ſacrifice of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115662:96"/> his was both acceptable and effectual. Fourthly, that <hi>God would have thee to come unto him for life,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>ſurety,</hi> and <hi>Mediator,</hi> and only <hi>hope</hi> of ſinners. Fifthly, that <hi>Chriſt hath in him all,</hi> and enough to make up thy ſtate, and to reconcile thee and God, and to get full pardon, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thee righteous, and to procure for thee eternal life. Sixthly, that <hi>Chriſt ſeeks</hi> even <hi>after thee by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel,</hi> and both offers himſelf with all his purchaſe unto thee, and hath, and yet doth <hi>beſeech thee</hi> to accept of him: I ſay, ſtudy theſe things; who knows how the great ſtudies of Chriſt may be at length bleſſed with faith in Chriſt? This I am ſure of, that the <hi>ignorance</hi> of the <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>offices,</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> and <hi>benefits,</hi> and <hi>alſufficiency,</hi> and <hi>marvellous affections,</hi> and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Chriſt is a notable ſtrength to unbeliefe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> on the contrary, the knowledge of them is a good means for faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another is the <hi>ſtudy of the new Covenant:</hi> Why, what mayeſt thou not there ſee to draw on thy ſoul to Chriſt? yea, what arguments doth God there fill thy mouth with to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer himſelf? He gives thee in that Covenant, ample and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing grounds by which thou ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt with an humble confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence even <hi>plead with him for Chriſt and faith:</hi> Thou ſhalt ſee there <hi>all thy good ſet freely open,</hi> that God ſtands not for this, nor for that, and it matters not what thou haſt been, there is mercy enough for what is paſt and there is <hi>grace</hi> to renew thy heart for the preſent, and ſtrength for the future, and thou mayeſt ſue out the Lord for this faith (of which we now ſpeak) and he will ſurely give it unto thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Study the main hinderances of diſtance twixt Chriſt, and the Covenant,</hi> and thy ſoul. There is one thing (above all the reſt) which keeps thee off, and that is <hi>unbelief:</hi> For God doth not require any other thing of thee in the entrance of Chriſt but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accept of him. He doth not ſay, if thou hadſt never offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, then I would have beſtowed my Sonne on thee; or, if thou hadſt not offended me ſo much, or if thou canſt bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſingular nature, and excellent qualities of thine own, then I will give my Sonne unto thee, or then I will give thee leave; No, but all that he requires is this, <hi>Beleeve</hi> and accept of my Sonne to be thy <hi>Lord and Saviour,</hi> and I will in him give thee pardon.</p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:115662:97"/>
                  <p> Why, now brethren, this is the laſt and ſore check of the match, our hearts are unbelieving, we will not condeſcend to this condition, but fly hovering after ſome unknown and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed method of our own.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Study much the ſinfulneſſe of unbelief:</hi> that it is a ſinne, and a great ſinne, and that in thee: What! after all ſenſe of miſery to hold off from remedy; not to cloſe with Gods great love, as if God were not wiſe enough to ſhew thee the way of ſalvation, or as if he were not <hi>true,</hi> that thou dareſt not to venture and faſten thy ſoule and ſtate upon his Word.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Study well wherein the nature of faith doth conſiſt:</hi> Many <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                     </label> perſons ſeeme to complaine that they have no faith, and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                     </label> cannot believe: Why? they are not right in the doctrinal part of faith, they miſtake faith exceedingly, thinking it to conſiſt in a <hi>full aſſurance,</hi> and in a <hi>ſenſible taſte of Gods love in Chriſt,</hi> and in a ſenſible and clear perſwaſion that their ſins are pardoned, which, becauſe as yet they never had, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perplex themſelves much about faith.</p>
                  <p>Therefore inform thy ſelf what <hi>faith in Chriſt is; It is the hearty accepting of Chriſt upon his own conditions;</hi> if thy heart and ſoul are willing to accept of Chriſt as the only Lord to <hi>rule thee,</hi> and as the <hi>only Redeemer to ſave thee,</hi> and to <hi>cleave unto him for better for worſe,</hi> through all the changes which may befal thee for Chriſts ſake, why this is faith, <hi>viz. An accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his perſon,</hi> and a <hi>repoſing of the ſoul upon him for its ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and a <hi>cleaving to him upon all ſtates.</hi> If thou canſt finde thus much, that there is no one ſinne which ſhall rule thee, to the love and obedience of which thou wilt reſigne thy ſelfe, but Chriſt is he whom thou chooſeſt for to be thy Lord; And there is no <hi>Name in heaven and earth upon which thou wilt put confidence for thy righteouſneſſe and diſcharge,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but <hi>only in Christ.</hi> And upon him thy ſoul entirely and unfainedly deſires to reſt it ſelf, thou haſt true faith.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Know this and convince thy ſelf of it,</hi> that thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hurt thy ſelf, nor <hi>offend God if thou couldeſt believe;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath God given Chriſt? and wherefore hath Chriſt given himſelfe? and wherefore is he now offered to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? and wherefore are we commanded to beleeve, if
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115662:97"/> yet to beleeve (that is) to accept of Chriſt, to conſent to the acceptance of his perſon upon his own condition were a ſinne?</p>
                  <p>7. Withal this <hi>beg fervently of God,</hi> that he would perſwade thy heart to <hi>beleeve</hi> (that is) to accept of Chriſt to be thy <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> and to reſt thy ſoul upon him: <hi>No man comes to me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>except the Father draw him,</hi> Now then, <hi>O Lord draw me, and I ſhall runne after thee,</hi> O ſubdue this unbeleeving heart, and give unto me the Spirit of faith, and love, and obedience.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, look <hi>for this gift of faith</hi> to be wrought in thee <hi>by the Spirit of Chriſt in the Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>wait upon God there continually.</hi> Thou ſhalt in time (perhaps ſooner, perhaps later) finde thy ſoule touched, and thy feares anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thy ſoule made exceedingly willing to accept of Chriſt as thy Lord, and to put it ſelf upon him as thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
                  <p>Yea, <hi>hold on in waiting and ſeeking</hi> and thou ſhalt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have Chriſt formed in thee, and <hi>faith</hi> formed in thee, but thou ſhalt come to know him, whom thou haſt accepted and truſted.</p>
                  <p>This is a ſweet and ſafe courſe for a ſenſible ſinner, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. To <hi>preſent up his requeſt unto God in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> earneſtly beſeeching him to declare this Almighty working of his Spirit in cauſing the heart to beleeve.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then <hi>to ſtand in the wayes of grant,</hi> and come to the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> wherein God doth <hi>reveale his arme,</hi> and give faith, and ſo enclines and unites the ſoul with Chriſt. What thou doeſt earneſtly ſeek in a <hi>private way,</hi> that God doth ordinarily anſwer and beſtow in a <hi>publick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then <hi>wait</hi> and <hi>expect,</hi> not to <hi>limit God</hi> juſt to this time, nor to this preacher, nor to caſt off all confidence of anſwer, upon preſent denials, but to look up from day to day, from week to week, if at length God will give thee faith.

                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>greatneſſe of ſinning</hi> ſhould be a ſtrong reaſon to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> compel in the ſoul to Chriſt: Great ſinnings are never eaſed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by diſpaire, or by unbelief: But two things they ſhould cauſe. 1.

                  <p>Why! what are thy thoughts of Chriſt, and of redemption in him? doeſt thou not know?</p>

                  <p> Firſt, that the <hi>ſinner muſt finde his full diſcharge in his blood?</hi> thou muſt be beholding to Chriſt for the payment of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, as well as of the greateſt debt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the <hi>ſtrength and merit of Chriſts death exceeds the merit of all ſin? where ſin abounded, there grace abounded much more:</hi> If it had not, then the ſinner could not have been pardoned, for then juſtice had not been ſatisfied.</p>

                  <p>Why! if ſins had not been great, or if the greatneſſe of them did prejudice from Chriſt really, God would never have given ſo great a Saviour as Chriſt; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>that he is able to ſave to the utmoſt.</hi> And, that he <hi>redeemes us from the law,</hi> Gal. 4. <hi>From all tranſgreſſion,</hi> whatſoever committed againſt the Law, and from all the <hi>curſes of the Law againſt them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Chriſt hath already anſwered this ſcruple,</hi> by giving <hi>inſtances of mercy</hi> to <hi>great ſinners;</hi> was not <hi>David</hi> a <hi>murderer of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah?</hi> was not <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> a foul ſinner? was not <hi>Zacheus</hi> a griping oppreſſor? was not <hi>Paul</hi> a bitter and ſore perſecutor? were not thoſe amongſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſinners in the higheſt forme? and yet Chriſt called them, and waſhed them, and juſtified them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the <hi>matter</hi> is not 'twixt thee and Chriſt, about the greatneſſe or littleneſſe of former ſinnings, but about the preſent diſpoſition and affection of thy ſoul; not what thou haſt loved heretofore, but what thou wilt now love; not what thou haſt followed, and ſerved heretofore, but what thou wilt now chuſe and obey.

                  <p>This is the wiſe skill of a Chriſtian, truly to obſerve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per riſe of faith.</p>

So is it here about faith in Chriſt; if thou doeſt conſider thy own body, thy own deſerts, thy own excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, thou ſhalt never beleeve, for faith can finde no ground in theſe to encourage the ſoul; but the <hi>ground of faith is without our ſelves:</hi> Why; God offers me Chriſt, and Chriſt calls me unto him, <hi>being heavy laden,</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>that he, who beleeves in him, ſhall have eternal life.</hi> Now this is a word of truth, and this word of his is <hi>worthy of all acceptation,</hi> I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture my ſoul upon it.</p>
                  <p>It is with faith as with a bird, caſt him into the water he cannot flie, that element is too groſſe for him, he cannot ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and beat his wings there, and therefore is kept down, but caſt him into the aire, which is a more pure element, then

So God commands the ſoul <hi>to beleeve in Chriſt,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him. The ſoul now looks on the excellencies of the gift, but forgets the obligation of duty: Its true, Chriſt is a moſt excellent gift and bleſſing, there is not ſuch a thing in all the world for a poore ſinner as Chriſt, but then know: that his excellencies may not take thee off from thy duty; This is his <hi>Commandment, that we beleeve on the Name of his Sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brethren, you are miſtaken, to beleeve in Chriſt being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto us in the Goſpel, it is not a matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, I may, or I may not; nor is it a matter of curteſie, as if we did a work of ſupererogation more then God requires; nay, but it is a <hi>matter of conſcience,</hi> a man ſinnes he violates a command, an evangelical precept, if he doth not beleeve; It is not a diſpute of worthineſſe or unworthineſſe, but it is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Command which thou art to look upon.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Chriſt is given out of rich grace, and mercy, and love,</hi> and therefore none can receive him but the unworthy. There is this difference 'twixt the reward of Juſtice, and the gift of graciouſneſſe; <hi>Juſtice</hi> hath an <hi>eye upon the diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>acts of the perſon,</hi> and according unto their qualities and degrees doth it commenſurate reward or puniſhment. But <hi>graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> hath an <hi>eye only upon it ſelf,</hi> the free bountifulneſſe of its own nature is the reaſon of its gifts and acts. Suppoſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115662:101"/> that a <hi>King executes a malefactor,</hi> this is an <hi>act of juſtice,</hi> and findes cauſe in the rebellion of the offendor; Suppoſe that a King <hi>pardons a malefactor,</hi> this is an <hi>act of graciouſneſſe,</hi> and findes its reaſon only in the breaſt of the King, and not in the worthineſſe of the delinquent. Thou ſtand'ſt upon thy worthineſſe, O, if I were worthy of Chriſt! why; but is not Chriſt a gift? he is often ſaid to be <hi>given;</hi> yea, but is he not a gracious gift? See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>God did ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding riches of his grace in his kindneſſe towards us through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, if ever there were a <hi>gift free-given,</hi> it is Chriſt. If Chriſt be a <hi>gracious gift,</hi> then he is not beſtowed on the <hi>worthy,</hi> but on the <hi>unworthy:</hi> not on him who can challenge and ſay, Lord there is good reaſon why I ſhould have Chriſt, and thou ſhouldeſt do me wrong if I have him not; O no, but he is a gracious gift, and therefore the broken ſinner may come in and ſay, O Lord, though I am unworthy, yet give me Chriſt; graciouſneſſe doth not expect any motion out of it ſelf, and therefore, though in reſpect of my deſert, ſhame and confuſion be my portion, yet thy <hi>gifts of grace are free,</hi> for thy exceeding riches of grace, and mercy, and love, give me thy Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, conſider his <hi>many perſonal invitations:</hi> he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from his own mouth both counſelled and envited the poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unto him. <hi>I counſel thee to buy gold, and raiment, and eye ſalve,</hi> Rev. 3. 18. <hi>The Spirit and the bride ſay come, and let him that heareth ſay, come, and let him that is a thirſt come, and whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>Ho! every one that thirſteth come ye to the waters, and be that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea, come buy wine and milk without money and without price; hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your ſoul delight it ſelf in fatneſs; Encline your eare, and come unto me, and your ſoul ſhall live; And I will make with you an everlaſting Covenant, even the ſure mercies of David.</hi> Iſa. 55. 1, 2. 3. <hi>Behold, I have given him for a witneſſe to the people.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>Jeſus ſtood and cryed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If any man thirſt let him come unto me and drink,</hi> John 7. 37.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider, he hath <hi>aſſured thee of acceptance: Him</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> John 6. 37. He will not ſhut the door againſt thee when he hath envited thee, but thou ſhalt be a welcome gueſt; nay, he will ſurely do thee good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there was never <hi>any one who did come unto him,</hi> but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <hi>ſped well.</hi> Thou canſt not finde any one Iota of unwillingneſſe, nor of his diſregard, but <hi>all</hi> have found him to be a merciful <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> and a compaſſionate Saviour, who have accepted of him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, conſider, that he doth ſtill <hi>negotiate with thee:</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Though he be returned to the higheſt heavens; yet he hath diſpatched <hi>Embaſſadors in his Name,</hi> to publiſh, and to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and to beſeech thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>Now then we are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God.</hi> V. 21. <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:115662:103"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If there were any hope of reconciliation (may a man reply) then I ſhould believe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Why, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But if God had commanded any <hi>in his Name</hi> to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> He hath <hi>committed to us the word of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you may do it out of <hi>your compaſſion,</hi> not from a <hi>commiſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> We are <hi>Embaſſadours for Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>pray you in Chriſts ſtead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But our <hi>ſins</hi> will <hi>prejudice</hi> the <hi>Reconciliation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol. He hath made him to be ſin for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, conſider <hi>his marvellous patience:</hi> If he were not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> willing, he would never have re-inforced his ſuit, but would have taken the firſt denial.</p>
                  <p>But he hath followed them, who have fled from him: He hath gone after the ſinner, who hath many times turned his back, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>All the day long have I stretched out my hand unto a diſobedient and gainſaying people.</hi> In this ſenſe we may apply that of the Prophet; <hi>He doth wait that he may be gracious,</hi> and yet continues his Embaſſadors to bring thee home unto him.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, conſider <hi>His ſad complaints</hi> for thy holding off <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and not beleeving: when <hi>he came neer to Hieruſalem, he wept over it,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>How often would I have gathered thee?</hi> Matth. 23. 37. <hi>And O if thou hadſt known, even thou, at the least in this thy day, the things which concern thy peace,</hi> Luke 19. 41, 42. <hi>And why will you not come unto me?</hi> John 5. 40. As if you did ſee a tender father purſuing a rebellious childe, and working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by counſel and entreaties, and by hands of bounty, and he will not yet hearken, the father ſteps to a friend, and powers out tears, O I cannot win him, I cannot turn him, doth not this ſhew a willingneſſe? So, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, conſider his <hi>Will is exhibited to us in all the kindes of</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                     <hi>willingneſſe:</hi> I obſerve that his will may be manifeſted three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in <hi>commands,</hi> and there is a <hi>preceptive will,</hi> and Chriſt commands thee to beleeve.</p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:115662:104"/>
                  <p> Secondly, in <hi>promiſes,</hi> and there is a gracious and <hi>encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>will,</hi> and Chriſt hath promiſed himſelf and all that he hath done and ſuffered, if thou wilt beleeve in him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in threatnings: and there is a <hi>juſt and vindictive will,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and Chriſt hath pronounced an abiding wrath, and an everlaſting death againſt him that will not beleeve; So that this is moſt clear, that Chriſt is moſt willing that a poor ſinner ſhould come in and embrace him, and be ſaved by him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The order of aſſurance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then for the order of aſſurance, that Chriſt is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve that there is a double aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One which is <hi>precedent,</hi> and grounds the ſoul to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another is <hi>ſubſequent,</hi> and attends the ſoul after its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. That <hi>precedent aſſurance conſiſts in a clear and convincing demonstration, that Chriſt is willing to be taken by the ſinner.</hi> This <hi>ſubſequent aſſurance</hi> conſiſts in a <hi>reflexive perſwaſion,</hi> that he is my Chriſt and Saviour, being by <hi>faith taken and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if a ſinner expects this latter aſſurance before he will beleeve, he doth prepoſterouſly and vainly perplex his ſoule; nay, it is an impoſſibility to lead on the ſoul this way; nay, it were a falſhood and a deluſion to the ſoul, if it had a reflexive aſſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance, that Chriſt and his benefits are mine, before the heart did by faith beleeve in him, and accept of him: I did couſen my ſoul with a lie, for Chriſt is not that mans who doth not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on him; the ways of this kinde of aſſurance, is as it were the eccho of the original wayes of faith a conſequent of it, but never an antecedent. For a man to ſolace himſelf, that the eſtate is his, before the perſon is his; or that the perſon is his, before he hath accepted of the perſon: Why, this is but the fruit of a vain and idle fancy. But the former aſſurance that is a ſweet inducement unto the ſoul to beleeve, <hi>viz.</hi> when the ſoul ban get three things cleared and reſolved. 1. The <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of a Saviour.</hi> 2. The <hi>alſufficiency of him.</hi> 3. <hi>His willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> to embrace and accept of a beleeving ſinner. Now this aſſurance is to be drawn from the very nature, and offices, and diſpoſitions of Chriſt, and from the command, and invitations,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115662:104"/> and promiſes of the Goſpel; which when the ſoul hath throughly peruſed, and ſcanned, it ſhall clearly ſee and freely acknowledge, (if it wil not blaſphemouſly ſuſpect Gods own truths for lies) that <hi>Chriſt is both an able and alſo a willing Saviour,</hi> not only willing to lay down his life, but moſt willing that ſinners ſhould come to him and believe in him, and ſo find eternal life.</p>
                  <p>So that you may from this take notice of three things.</p>
                  <p>One, That <hi>to be aſſured of Chriſt, as mine,</hi> is no ground for to move a man to believe, but it <hi>is a conſequent of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another, that to be <hi>aſſured that Chriſt is willing,</hi> and ready to be mine, and to accept of me, this is a <hi>ſweet motive,</hi> and an <hi>encouraging ground</hi> for the ſoul to believe.</p>
                  <p>A third, there is no better way to <hi>feel the ſweetneſſe of Chriſts being willing</hi> to beſtow himſelf upon a man, then <hi>by believing firſt on him,</hi> for it is faith in Chriſt which opens to a man all his intereſts in Chriſt: And if this be ſure, that Chriſts willingneſſe prevents thine, if therefore thou be willing to accept, the very nature of the treaty and match aſſures thee ſufficiently that Chriſt was ready long ago.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Obj.</hi> But then ſaith the ſenſible ſinner, I am not prepared and humble enough: Chriſt is to <hi>binde up the broken hearted,</hi> but <hi>my heart is ſtill hard,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt is to open the priſon for them that are bound,</hi> but I am not (at leaſt) <hi>in ſufficient bondage,</hi> and he is to give the oile of joy for mourning, but I have no melting, nor mourning ſpirit, and therefore I may not believe on him, nor take him, for I am diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I ſhall not need to ſay much to this, becauſe I have touched heretofore upon in the Expoſition of <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 1. yet I will touch a little at this time.</p>
                  <p>1. There is a <hi>twofold humbling</hi> according to a <hi>double cauſe of it.</hi> One is in the <hi>exceedings beating of the conſcience,</hi> with inward terrors and feares, ſpringing from the <hi>Power of the Law,</hi> which quickens the conſcience, and wounds it with the expreſſe ſenſe of former guilt, and which preſents God in all the glories and terrors of his juſtice, and as the great and ſure avenger of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous perſon. When the ſoul is in this kinde of humbling, it is filled with exquiſite ſenſe, and exquiſite torment, like a man with a burning arrow in his thigh, or like a thief hearing the ſentence of death pronounced upon him by the judge. Now this <hi>kinde</hi>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:115662:105"/> 
                     <hi>of humbling,</hi> though (ſometimes) it may be an <hi>antecedent to faith in Chriſt,</hi> (for God doth many times bring a man to heaven by the gates of hell, he doth bruiſe, and wound, and even kill him by the <hi>terrors of the Law,</hi> and then revive him with the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and <hi>tender goodneſſe of the Goſpel)</hi> yet it may be (poſſibly) without any future acceſſe of the ſoul to Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt. For this, mark, that though God doth many times graciouſly ſuperad another work of converſion, to this of legall affliction, yet he may and doth many times diſtribute theſe ſorrows in wrath, and they are but the teſtimonies of his pure and diſpleaſed juſtice, even in this life, to begin an hell of anguiſh in the conſcience of a proud and daring ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Another is in the <hi>tender abaſings and ſweet bathings or mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the affections,</hi> when there is a fountaine of ſorrow ſet open within the ſoul, giving out it ſelf in ſeverall ſtreames of melting, becauſe of <hi>ſin and tranſgreſſion.</hi> Now this latter is not an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, but a conſequent of faith in Chriſt, as you ſhall hear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
                  <p>A man cannot rightly judge of his fitneſſe to lay hold on Chriſt by the meer ſtrength or meaſure of any legall humbling, but by the Iſſue and event of them.</p>
                  <p>If inſtead of one <hi>item</hi> from conſcience, thou ſhouldeſt now heare an hundred; and inſtead of one laſh from conſcience, thou ſhouldſt now feel a thouſand, though thy heart were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into as many pieces as the glaſſe which is daſhed againſt the wall; though thy ſpirits did even fry within thee, for the heat of horror, and that thou didſt roare day and night for the diſquietment of thy guilty conſcience, yet couldſt thou not confidently affirme by all this, I am now for Chriſt, and Chriſt will aſſuredly accept of me, I ſhall not miſſe of him.</p>
                  <p>Reaſons whereof are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe theſe may be Gods tokens of juſt vengeance on thee, meer puniſhments and judicial acts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſoul under theſe may be rather taken up with the ſtinging guilt and feares of ſin, then with the foul vileneſſe, and baſe nature, and acts thereof (ſtanding in contrariety to the holy and good will of a gracious God.)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The thus <hi>afflicted ſoul</hi> may <hi>cry out for Chriſt,</hi> meerly out of ſelf-love, to eaſe the burden, but not to cure the nature, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115662:105"/> it from paine, but not to heal it of the ſinfull inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this I would ſay to any <hi>legall broken ſpirit,</hi> do not judge of fitneſſe meerly by the ſtrength or depth of teares; there is a threefold enough, 1. Intenſive for the degree. 2. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive for the time. 3. Diſpoſitive for the efficacy; therefore do but obſerve what diſpoſition attends and follows theſe: There be five things which if they follow upon legall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, may be ſubordinate encouragements to the heart, to put it ſelf upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if <hi>quite driven out of ones ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if <hi>ſin comes to be felt as the baſeſt evil,</hi> as the guilt of it hath been found the ſoreſt paine.</p>
                  <p>A third is if the <hi>heart</hi> finds it ſelf any way <hi>looſened from the league of iniquity;</hi> yea, and that a ſecret war is begun now 'twixt the ſoul and the ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, an <hi>high eſtimate and valuation of Chriſt,</hi> as the only and choiſeſt good of my ſoul and hope, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>active and fervent deſire to put the ſoul under the Government of the Lord Ieſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether thy legall humblings be great or ſmall, long or ſhort, more or leſſe, that's not the thing; but if they be thus attended, thou mayeſt ſafely venture thy ſoul upon the Lord Jeſus, thou mayeſt believe, and he will in no wiſe refuſe thee.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> will not <hi>hinder the humblings or meltings of thy ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I obſerve when there is a Thunder-clap, then there is ſuch a hurry in the cloud, that fire flaſheth out, and the cloud is bruſt inſunder, and a mighty deluge of water is thrown down; and you may likewiſe obſerve that the Sun doth (though there be no ſtorme) draw up and ſweetly open and pierce the clouds, which thereby give down the moſt ſeaſonable and refreſhing ſhowres of rain. The Law is like a Thunder-clap, it doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſo toſſe, and hurry, and vex the conſcience, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſighes, and feares, and teares guſh out: But then faith makes the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe to ariſe</hi> within the ſoul, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing melts the heart more then Chriſt apprehended by faith.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115662:106"/> 
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they pierced, and they ſhall mourne for him as one mourneth for his onely ſon, and they ſhall be in bitterneſſe for him as one that is in bitterneſſe for his first-born.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>ſees the greateſt love, the ſweeteſt kindneſſe, the freeſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Reaſons of it.</note> 
                     <hi>the readieſt acceptations;</hi> all which do even me it the heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a river, and works the greateſt mournings.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but the very behaviour of the <hi>father of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> brake the heart of him with more thawings and kindly mournings, then ever did his former miſery and hardſhip; O this, that though he was an ungracious ſpend-thrift, a ſtubborne childe, a lewd companion, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. yet <hi>his father ſhould run to meet him,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>fall upon his neck and kiſſe him,</hi> the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe lips wounded his heart with the deeper ſenſe and judging of his own unkindneſſe. So when a ſinner ſhall by faith ſee Chriſt ſteping forward in the Goſpel, puting forth the hand to him, calling him, come, thou <hi>haſt done evil as thou canſt,</hi> haſt wronged my father, me, my ſpirit, my ſervants, thy ſelfe, I will get thee pardon for all, feare not, nor be diſmayed, I will will take upon me the diſcharge, I will be thine, my blood thine, my righteouſneſſe thine; O, this melts the heart: thou canſt not take Chriſt, but thy heart will break, nor read thy pardon, but thine eyes will melt; what for me, Lord; yea, for thee, what after ſuch deep rebellions; yea, after all, and that moſt freely and willingly; Good Lord, how the ſoul weeps now, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>faith ſees ſin in the greateſt vileneſſe:</hi> It is one thing to ſee ſin, <hi>Hell-gates,</hi> and another thing to ſee ſin (if I may ſo allude) <hi>at Heaven-gates,</hi> there I ſee it in its reward, which cauſeth feare, here I ſee it in its proper nature, which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hatred. when I can ſee ſin as the wrong of a righteous and holy will, as a rebellion againſt a holy and juſt Law, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of a great and holy God, as the ſpeare thruſting through the <hi>heart of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the baſeſt quality, and vileſt abuſe, and indignity to love, and mercy, and blood; now, now I begin to melt, to grieve, a God is wronged, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is wronged, a Saviour is wronged.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Faith melts the promiſes,</hi> and the <hi>promiſes melt the heart:</hi> Why?
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115662:106"/> brethren, our ſoft and mourning hearts are not firſt in us, and then in the promiſes, but firſt in them, and from them they come down into us. <hi>The heart of fleſh</hi> is firſt in that promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and give you an heart of fleſh,</hi> and thence it comes to the perſon for to faſhion and mollifie his heart. But what draws the promiſes? Is it not faith: It is the only hand which reacheth out unto them, and receives them; whence it doth fully follow, that beleeving will be no prejudice, but a great furtherance to thy mournful hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings and ſoftnings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> I grant it, when a man can indeed beleeve; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving will much abate, and perhaps remove the actuals of an <hi>horrible ſtumbling;</hi> (that is) a man ſhall not now feel ſuch a deſperate terrifying, bitter, hopeleſſe anguiſh as before, but yet it doth open a full veine within the ſoul, which drops with vitall ſorrows, with gracious lamentings, with hearty diſpleaſures, with hopeful tears; and though under them the ſoul is not ſo hurried, yet it weeps bitterly, as the wife which holds the lately reconciled husband by the hand, or as the child which is newly pardoned and embraced.</p>
                  <p>This is a truth, that faith can heale the teares of a ſlave, and breed the tears of a childe: It can <hi>rebuke</hi> the ragings of <hi>the ſea,</hi> and yet continue its <hi>flowing courſes;</hi> It can ſtill a raging conſcience, and yet beget a ſtreame of godly ſorrow; it can both <hi>quiet a troubled ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>raiſe</hi> within us a <hi>ſoft and mourning heart.</hi> Yea to ſpeak plainly, a man never till then begins to mourn as a childe, till he hath faith to ſee God as a father, and the gracious looks of Chriſt (which only faith eſpies) they upbraid our ſinnings more, and no ſuch ſprings of grief as they.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Obj.</hi> But I have <hi>ſtood out my day,</hi> and have <hi>refuſed many invitations,</hi> and <hi>offers,</hi> as, now <hi>I may not beleeve.</hi> I am ſure that Chriſt will never regard me, becauſe of my former <hi>proud refuſals of him</hi> in his <hi>gracious offers and invitations:</hi> Now the <hi>day is gone, It is too late.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol,</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That not only the <hi>poſitive refuſals,</hi> but alſo the <hi>ſlighting pretermiſſions</hi> of the <hi>voice of the Goſpel,</hi> are (undoubted) <hi>ſinful,</hi> for if diſobedience to the Law, then much more unto the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:115662:107"/> is very bad; no man can refuſe his remedy, but he makes his wound the greater.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again it is granted, the <hi>greater kinde of refuſal,</hi> adde a <hi>greater meaſure of guilt:</hi> the refuſals of <hi>light againſt light,</hi> is a more dark condition: (that is) when a man knows the Goſpel to be the voice of Chriſt, and to propound heaven and mercy upon the only termes, and yet he is not gathered, this is ſinne in more degrees then the paſſing over it, then igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and inobſervation: againe, the more <hi>wilfully</hi> a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth his <hi>opportunity</hi> and invitations, this alſo makes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal more hainous, and calls upon the ſoule for greater humblings.</p>
                  <p>But then know, <note place="margin">5<hi>s Things.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Chriſt is not alwayes ſo quick to break off</hi> (for ever) <hi>for ſome refuſals:</hi> It is not an uncapable condition, (a ſealed ſtate) if a man hath ſtood out againſt many particular invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. This ſimply is not the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, and therefore it is pardonable, and if the ſinne be pardonable, then the ſinner is capable of Chriſt, in whom alone ſin is to be pardoned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Scarce any beleever,</hi> (who is called after the ripeneſſe of yeares) but <hi>hath often refuſed</hi> (before his converſion) <hi>many invitations by grace and mercy.</hi> It were an horrid harſhneſſe for any Miniſter to ſend all them to hell, who once refuſe the news and tender of heaven: Nay, we ſee that Chriſt hath ſeveral ſeaſons of converſion, ſome he brings home to himſelf at the <hi>night,</hi> at the <hi>later end of the day,</hi> who queſtionleſſe refuſed him in the former part of the day; nay, that grace <hi>which doth gather a man to Chriſt, conquers our refuſing hearts, Ergo,</hi> meer refuſing is not an eternal prejudice. It is true, that whiles I do refuſe, I cannot beleeve, yet though I have formerly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I may yet beleeve.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>double refuſal</hi> of Chriſt, and the invitations of the Goſpel; one is <hi>malitious,</hi> this is fearful; another is <hi>temerarious,</hi> and this is <hi>pardonable:</hi> That is accompanied with a <hi>deſpiteful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit,</hi> this depends much upon <hi>raſhneſſe, temptations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, there is a <hi>double refuſal;</hi> one is <hi>total,</hi> but <hi>temporary;</hi> A man doth not hearken, though Chriſt doth call, he will
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115662:107"/> not ſubſcribe, though Chriſt propounds, but goes in his own way and courſe, yet at length with <hi>Paul,</hi> he may be <hi>ſtruck to the ground,</hi> and yeild up himſelf to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Another is, <hi>total</hi> and <hi>final,</hi> which is an <hi>impenitent rebellion;</hi> A man holds out againſt the voice of Chriſt for ever, there is no hope for ſuch a perſon.</p>
                  <p>2. No broken and <hi>grieved heart for former refuſals</hi> can juſtly ſay, that it hath <hi>ſtood out its day,</hi> and it is <hi>too late to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a thing of ſome concernment, and many are very ſtrict in it; I will only preſent my thoughts amidſt the crowd of conjectures.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, how <hi>punctual Gods day of grace is</hi> in the offer of Chriſt; ſo that if a man doth not take it in the firſt moment of tender, <hi>I think none can tell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>to ſay of this or that particular man,</hi> that he is gone <hi>beyond his day,</hi> for ought I know, goes beyond our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that <hi>at any time</hi> when the <hi>Goſpel is publiſhed,</hi> then it ought preſently to be embraced, <hi>To day if you will heare his voice, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>God</hi> doth not <hi>take away from a man his day alwayes immediately upon his firſt refuſal,</hi> if ſo, perhaps it would have been night with all the world ere this.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is probable that the <hi>day of grace</hi> is not cloſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a particular perſon, when <hi>his heart begins to be broken for former refuſals:</hi> for when men out-ſtand this day, uſually they are given up to a ſeared conſcience, to a <hi>reprobate minde,</hi> to a <hi>ſenſible ſtupidity,</hi> and to the works of ſinne with greedineſſe; they grow worſe and worſe, being not only deſtitute of all ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning qualities, but being more hardned by the Goſpel, which they refuſed and deſpiſed. The man who out-ſtands his day, is either <hi>deprived of the ſound of the Goſpel,</hi> or elſe he hath only the <hi>judicial power of it working upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>grief of the heart for former standings out, this,</hi> I ſay, <hi>proclaimes that thy day is not ſet,</hi> nay, this <hi>is thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and ſpecial day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vines do diſtinguiſh of the day.</p>
                  <p>One is <hi>General,</hi> like the riſing of the Sunne, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115662:108"/> riſing and publiſhing of the Goſpel makes a day.</p>
                  <p>Another is <hi>ſpecial</hi> which is like one of the twelve houres in the day, when the Spirit of God begins to make day within the heart, and Chriſt is dealing and ſecretly parling with the ſoul, by conviction of its former refuſals, by ſweet humblings and meltings for ſuch proud and erroneous deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: That the <hi>Prince of my peace</hi> ſhould be refuſed, that the <hi>Lord of my life</hi> ſhould be refuſed, that the <hi>termes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy</hi> ſhould be refuſed, O how the heart judgeth, condemns rents, and afflicts it ſelf for it; falls down at the feet of Chriſt, <hi>not worthy O Lord</hi> to look upon thee, whom I have ſo often undervalued. This is a ſpecial day, here's a ſeaſon for thee, thou mayeſt go to Chriſt, Chriſt hath dealt with thee effectually, this is the acceptable time.</p>
                  <p>4. If thou <hi>haſt stood out againſt Chriſt hitherto,</hi> thou haſt therefore now the <hi>more reaſon to come in,</hi> and not to refuſe the offer yet continued.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>that former rebellions</hi> are never taken off by <hi>by new and continued:</hi> For this is to make ſinning much the worſe; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou didſt refuſe Chriſt heretofore through ignorance, (thou didſt not ſee <hi>his excellencies,</hi> nor <hi>thine own neceſſity)</hi> or perhaps through <hi>inadvertency</hi> or <hi>careleſneſſe,</hi> thou didſt not wiſely and ſeriouſly heed that great ſalvation in him: But now thou art convinced, now thou ſeeſt thy refuſals, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pretermiſſions to be ſinful: Why; is this the way to cure the former by adding more refuſals? Didſt thou well to refuſe him upon his own termes? if thou didſt ill then ceaſe refuſing; labour to accept of them: Thou canſt never <hi>pleaſe God</hi> by continuing in a ſin, nor <hi>help thy ſelf</hi> by pleading againſt thy duty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thy <hi>obligation</hi> and <hi>preſent duty ceaſeth not becauſe of former refuſals:</hi> It was thy duty to have received Chriſt at the firſt, and to this very day doth that duty lie upon thee: former miſcarriages ſhould <hi>cauſe our humblings,</hi> but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>diſannul our duties:</hi> Why; the Goſpel is yet in its revelation of Chriſt, and yet in its tenoer of Chriſt unto thee, and yet in commanding of thee to refuſe him no more, but to hearken and to beleeve, (that is) to accept of Chriſt to be thy Lord and Saviour.</p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:115662:108"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Oh why, what ſhould I do faith a ſoul that hath ſtood out?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, thou ſhouldeſt <hi>look</hi> back on thy <hi>withſtandings</hi> with <hi>hearty grievings,</hi> and ſhouldſt preſſe on towards thy <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> with <hi>fervent requeſtings;</hi> now lay down thy weapons, and ſtrive to give up thy ſelf to Chriſt, not to harden thy heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer, but beg of God day and night to forgive thy refuſals, and to give thee now a heart to beleeve and to yield.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Chriſt</hi> will <hi>accept</hi> of any man who is <hi>willing to lay down his weapons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 'Tis true that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Theſe mine enemies who will not have me to reigne over them, bring them forth and ſlay them before me;</hi> If a man will be ſtill an enemy, if he will not accept of Chriſt to be his Lord, to govern him, then Chriſt w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll be a Judge and enemy to that man, he ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> But it is as true, that if we accept of reconciliation, if we would lay aſide former enmity, if we come unto Chriſt and caſt our ſelves down at his feet, and give up the ſword which fought againſt him; if we confeſſe our rebellions, and beſeech him to accept of us into his ſervice, and into mercy; If we heartily deſire now to be the ſervants of righteouſneſſe, to take Chriſt to be our Lord, and to ſerve him alone, aſſuredly he will not refuſe us. Therefore, if any here this day have their ſpirits entangled with this ſcruple, that they now have refuſed Chriſt, and are paſt their day, but withal they finde their hearts bleeding for this, and they do now judge of Chriſt as the <hi>chiefeſt of ten thouſands,</hi> and it is the deſire of their ſouls to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and to put themſelves under the government of the Lord Jeſus, I ſay unto ſuch, fear not, come and accept of Chriſt, he will be reconciliation to thee; Though thou haſt been an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, yet if now thou wilt accept of the termes of peace, the Son of peace will certainly accept of thee.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Obj.</hi> Yet the ſenſible ſinner is not ſatisfied for all this, I am afraid, Why? becauſe I finde not only former <hi>guilts</hi> in a <hi>manifold number,</hi> but <hi>preſent corruptions in exceeding strength,</hi> no man living hath an abominable heart as I, ſurely the Lord Jeſus will loath me and depart from me, a ſinful wretch, I
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115662:109"/> cannot think otherwiſe, how then ſhould I beleeve?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> For ſome reſolution of this ſcruple, obſerve a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>ſenſe of the ſtrength of ſinne</hi> is no <hi>unhopeful ſymptom,</hi> nor prejudice to faith. Of all tempers, the <hi>hardned</hi> is moſt dangerous, and <hi>ſinne</hi> hath the <hi>greateſt ſtrength,</hi> where there is the <hi>leaſt ſenſe:</hi> A man ſeems to be nothing elſe but a lump of ſinne, when he is ſo wholly leavened and ſowred, that not a part in him can reflect upon it ſelf, and feel its filthineſſe; where the guilt of ſinne is no burden, and the nature of ſin is no trouble, that ſoul is in an ill caſe.</p>
                  <p>But the ſenſe of the ſtrength of ſinne imports ſomething elſe in the ſoul beſides ſin: When the patient is deadly ſick, he ſaith he is well and feels no paine, but when a patient is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering, he is full of ſenſe, and complains his head is weak, his ſtomack ſick, his bones lame, all is amiſſe. There is more hope of one ſenſible ſinner, then of a thouſand preſumptuous and hardned wretches; And God ſeldom or never gives a man a ſenſe of Chriſt, who hath not had firſt a <hi>ſenſe of his ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a double <hi>ſenſe of ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is meerly <hi>judicial,</hi> which is the feeling of the guilt of ſinne when God awakens the conſcience to apprehend its former ſinnings, and imprints ſome degrees of wrath upon it as the fruits of guilt; and now the ſinner is broken and cruſhed, for he feeles a kinde of hell in himſelf for his former ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another is <hi>more then judicial;</hi> It is ſomething more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and that is, when a man doth not only feele the guilt of ſinne as preſſing, but the nature of ſinne as an oppreſſing burden; He ſees and feels the inclinations and motions of his heart as moſt repungnant to the will and glory of God, and therefore is exceedingly afflicted and diſquieted: This now is an admirably hopeful Symptome.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief is no oure to the ſtrength of ſinne:</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou conjecture the <hi>ſtrength of ſinne</hi> to conſiſt in <hi>hardneſſe of heart,</hi> Why, <hi>unbelief</hi> will never ſoften thee; or whether thou conjecture the ſtrength of it, to conſiſt in the <hi>approbation of ſinne;</hi> Why, <hi>unbelief</hi> will never <hi>condemn</hi> and diſapprove it;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115662:109"/> or whether thou conjecture (though not rightly) its ſtrength to conſiſt in meere <hi>inclinations;</hi> why? why <hi>unbelief</hi> will never <hi>alter them;</hi> or whether thou thinkeſt its ſtrength conſiſts in <hi>frequency of actions or motions;</hi> why, <hi>unbelief</hi> will never <hi>remove or leſſen them;</hi> or whether thou thinkeſt its ſtrength conſiſts in <hi>commands and power,</hi> why, <hi>unbelief</hi> will never <hi>conquer them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> is a <hi>ſin it ſelf,</hi> and therefore can be <hi>no cure of ſinne,</hi> (for nothing cures the ſinner, but that which is contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin:) Nay, <hi>unbelief keeps</hi> off the ſoul <hi>from its cures,</hi> from its helps; the help of a ſinful ſoul is in heaven, but unbeliefe knows not the way upward, <hi>the heart of unbelief will depart from the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt is a Phyſician for a ſick ſinner,</hi> and he hath ſaid, that <hi>the whole need not the Phyſician, but the ſick.</hi> Why? The ſick perſon is no unſutable object or preſent for a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, his calling is to heale diſtempers and ſickneſſes; and thou mayeſt confidently go to Chriſt to have thy ſick ſoul healed. We cannot brethren, we cannot, and Chriſt knows it well enough, we cannot come to Chriſt, but we muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him for two things, One, his <hi>merit</hi> to get our ſins pardoned; Another is <hi>his Spirit,</hi> to get our ſinful natures chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And therefore Chriſt is appointed <hi>of God,</hi> not only to be Redemption, but alſo to be Sanctification; as he is the <hi>Author of ſalvation to us,</hi> ſo he is the <hi>Authour of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in us;</hi> We cannot come to him and bring good natures, O no, the grace which we want, <hi>is in Chriſt, in our Head,</hi> as water in the Spring, and <hi>from his fulneſſe muſt we receive grace for grace.</hi> None can change that vile heart of thine but Chriſt; <hi>His wings are healing,</hi> and to him art thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to come as the ſick perſon to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> in the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Covenant of grace</hi> (you know) is an undertaking, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for pardon, but for <hi>changing,</hi> and all the Covenant is made good in Chriſt: As if God ſhould ſay unto a ſinner, I know thou art a guilty perſon ful-well, and beſides that, thou haſt a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and abominable nature, but go to my Son, accept of him, there is thy pardon in him, and there is thy change in him, he ſhall juſtifie thee from thy guilt, and he ſhall ſanctifie thy nature from its vile corruption.</p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:115662:110"/>
                  <p> Fourthly, <hi>Jeſus</hi> will not <hi>loath thee becauſe of thy ſinful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but <hi>will help thee becauſe thou art a ſick perſon.</hi> Remember it for ever, the <hi>more vile</hi> thou art in thine own eyes, the <hi>more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> thou art in Chriſts opinion; I never read of any perſon who came to Chriſt, thou Lord heale me, but he was ſent away cured.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>What doeſt thou think of beleeving?</hi> what is thy opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of faith? what? as if faith were an enemy or hinderance to holineſſe? That it will either increaſe, or ſuffer lewdneſſe in the heart? far be it from thee ſo to think; O no, Faith is the ſingular way of encreaſing and getting all grace to thy ſoul, it deals altogether with holy principles, God, Chriſt, the Spirit, and with <hi>holy wayes,</hi> the Word, the Sacraments; Faith engageth all the goodneſſe and ſtrength of heaven for thy change, and for the renuing and ſubduing of thy ſinful heart. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and why? <hi>for ye are under grace:</hi> Mark it, <hi>under grace</hi> (that is) under a <hi>gracious Covenant,</hi> wherein God and Chriſt have engaged themſelves to their ayd and ſtrength; yea, but what makes us to be under this grace? Verily it is faith in Chriſt, in whom all grace is enſured to the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Nay, if thou couldeſt by faith accept of Chriſt to be thy Lord and Saviour, now mighteſt thou confidently go unto him to expreſſe the vertues of his Sovereignty and goodneſſe to thee; Now mighteſt thou plead with him for the excellencies of his Spirit; Lord Jeſus, I have beſtowed my ſelf on thee, and thou didſt invite and aſſure me, that thou wouldeſt be, not only righteouſneſſe, but ſanctification alſo unto me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, ſend forth the <hi>rod of thy Scepter,</hi> the <hi>vertues of thy grace,</hi> and change <hi>by thy holy Spirit</hi> this unholy heart of mine, <hi>ſubdue mine iniquities, caſt down every imagination exalting it ſelf againſt thee, bring into captivity</hi> (O my ſoul deſires to be captivated to thee, yea, by the) <hi>every thought, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a pregnant difference 'twixt <hi>preſumption</hi> and <hi>faith, preſumption</hi> is but the birth of an idle fancy, like a dreame of great matters, which yet hath no real bottome, but only flies out of a multiplying imagination which is full of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding acts.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>faith</hi> conjoynes the ſoul with a lively principle, with a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115662:110"/> true fountaine of grace with a root of holineſſe, even with Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe, without whom we can never be made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by whom (being <hi>ingraffed into him by faith)</hi> we ſhall be ſanctified throughout.</p>
                  <p>Look as the <hi>defiling qualities of our nature</hi> are <hi>firſt in Adam,</hi> and then in us his poſterity, ſo <hi>changing</hi> and <hi>ſanctifying quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> are <hi>firſt in Chriſt, the ſecond Adam,</hi> and from him derived to us his members.</p>
                  <p>And then know that there is not ſuch a <hi>Ligament</hi> to tie us in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Faith,</hi> nor is there any ſuch inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to draw out the vertues of Chriſt into the ſoul as faith.</p>
                  <p>You read of thoſe in the Goſpel who brought <hi>diſeaſed bodie: to Chriſt,</hi> and yet when they believed, they went away with <hi>cured and healed tempers;</hi> what doth this intimate unto us, but that the ſenſible ſinner weary of his ſinful nature, ſhould make his addreſſe unto the Lord Jeſus for cure, and health, and that he ſhould by faith accept of him, and truſt upon him for the healing of his ſoul, and the ſubduing of his ſins, and then verily you ſhall finde <hi>vertue to come from Chriſt,</hi> raiſing a greater hatred of ſin, war with it in the very fountaine, watching and praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and the power of the ordinance ſucceſſively weakening and crucifying the power of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, know this <hi>that the time of contrariety is the time for faith to work.</hi> When a man ſees <hi>death,</hi> then is it the time for faith to <hi>believe life?</hi> When he ſees the <hi>grave,</hi> then is it the time for faith to believe <hi>a reſurrection;</hi> when he ſees guilt, then is it the time for faith to believe <hi>pardoning mercy;</hi> when he ſees himſelf a ſinner then is it the time for faith to believe a <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That which the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient obſerves in himſelf, is ſickneſſe; and that which he hopes for in the medicine is health. Hath God made thee ſenſible of thy ſins, doſt thou finde thus much, that al that thou canſt do wil not become a rebuke of corruption, thou art able now to ſee the ſtrength of thy ſinfull nature, but to remove it thou art utterly
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115662:111"/> unable? Why, what is now to be done? truly, as in the ſenſe of the guilt of ſin, we muſt then flye by faith to God, and put our ſoules upon his free mercy for pardon, ſo in the ſenſe of the filthy ſtrength of ſin, we muſt to heaven by faith, and put our ſoules on Gods faithful promiſes in Chriſt, for the healing and ſubduing of it. This is the way, and therefore ſtrive to walk in it, you may try other waters, but they ſhall not help you, and perplex your own thoughts, but they ſhall not availe you, the cure of the ſinful ſoul is only in heaven, and it is faith only which can lift up a ſoul to God and Chriſt, which puts it into the Pool. When ſin is felt, then let faith work; If thou canſt finde any one promiſe which God hath made of ſanctifying and healing, and ſubduing; Why, here's ground for faith; yea, for thy ſaith, for in theſe promiſes are the cures of thy ſinful nature, and faith it is which will apply the healing medicines to thee.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Obj.</hi> Yet I am not ſatisfied, ſaith the ſenſible ſinner and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoul; Why, Becauſe, Firſt, <hi>I cannot finde an heart to duty,</hi> to pray and ſeek of God, and ſurely if God did purpoſe and mean any good to me, he would in ſome meaſure frame, and encline, and excite my heart towards him. Secondly, yea, and againe, though I do ſometimes ſeek and entreat, yet I obſerve that what I was, that I am, nothing comes of it, how then can I, may I, ſhould I be enduced to believe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Here are two ſore and real ſcruples which do indeed vehemently beat upon a ſenſible ſinner, I ſhall endeavour to aſſoyle them ſucceſſively.</p>
                  <p>1. I cannot finde an heart to any duty, to pray for faith, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. As the inability to <hi>holy duties</hi> depends on <hi>natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> ſo the <hi>indiſpoſition towards them</hi> depends exceedingly upon <hi>unbelief:</hi> There is nothing diſheartens a man more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God then it: For b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſides this, that unbelief in its own nature is a departure from God, (it is a bias drawing the ſoul downwards.) This alſo is true of it, that it <hi>repreſents God to the ſoul in all the appearances and methods of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> It makes the ſoul to ſee nothing in God, or from God, which might encline it to him: O, ſaith unbelief, there is ſuch <hi>holineſſe</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> in him, that he will never endure thee,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115662:111"/> there is ſuch truth and juſtice in him, that he will ſurely be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of thee.</p>
                  <p>There is ſuch <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>power in him,</hi> that he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly meet with thee, and lay load on thee: There is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, a <hi>mercifulneſſe in him,</hi> but alas his tender bowels of compaſſion, his ready forgiveneſſe extends not to thee; there are many ſweet intimations in his promiſes, but they concern not thee; there is a <hi>mighty ſalvation in Chriſt,</hi> and powerful interceſſion to ingratiate ſome perſons and their ſervices, but what of this to thee! He is a <hi>God hearing prayer;</hi> yea, but he will not regard the cryes nor tears of ſome, but their <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are an abomination unto him:</hi> And thus doth unbelief ſet up God utterly againſt the ſoule, ſo that the poor ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of God as an enemy, dares not come neer it, flies off it, is even afraid to ſpeak to him; It is perſwaded by unbeliefe, that God will frowne upon all that is done, whereupon the ſpirit ſinks, the affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> are flatted; I have no minde, nor heart, am like a lump, a ſtock, a ſtone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>it is faith</hi> which will <hi>fetch up the ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 27. 13. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>I had fainted, unleſſe I had beleeved to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, my ſpirits were even breathing themſelves out, I was even ſinking down, giving up all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I had beleeved, but that confidence of Gods goodneſſe towards me, that did put life into me, that did fetch me again, that did put heart into me.</p>
                  <p>You ſee now the ſpring is coming on, that thoſe (ſeemingly) dead branches of the trees, they begin to thruſt out ſome hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſproutings, and put on another colour of freſhneſſe, why? becauſe the root is now more fed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and warmed. It is faith which will put colour into our faces, and ſpirit into our hearts, and life into our duties.</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith ſets open the mercy-ſeat:</hi> It repreſents God to the <note place="margin">Two reaſons of it.</note> ſoul in all his attributes of graciouſneſſe, not as an hard ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but as a good God, willing to give audience to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> humble requeſts, and ſuit of a poore ſinner: Nay, willing to diſpatch, and grant his requeſts: <hi>What is thy requeſt,</hi> ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſhuerus to Queen Eſter, it ſhall be granted thee, &amp;c?</hi> So ſaith
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115662:112"/> the Lord, What wouldeſt thou have of me? Is it <hi>mercy?</hi> I do promiſe it unto thee; Is it <hi>grace?</hi> I promiſe that unto thee; Is it <hi>ſtrength?</hi> is it <hi>comfort?</hi> is it deliverance? what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be, if thou beleeve on me, I will not fail to give to thee. Nay, I will do it freely, nay, cheerfully, with all my heart, and with all my ſoul, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.</p>
                  <p>Yea, this makes the ſoul to come unto God, as the ſhip into the haven with full ſpeed, and ſtretched ſailes: O the ſoul bends the knee with cheerfulneſſe, when it ſees it ſhall be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with kindneſſe; a man may have ſome heart to pray, when he knows, <hi>My God will hear me,</hi> that God hath a readineſs to anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith ſets the ſoul in the prevailing wayes:</hi> it puts the ſoul to ſeek and pray with ſuch motives, as it is moſt ſure ſhall make it to ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>There are many motives which men take to prevaile with God; O, they can do nothing, God regards them not, the ſtrength of a mans excellencies, of his own worthineſſe, of his own abilities and frame alas, <hi>theſe are not the prevailing and binding motives,</hi> all theſe import that thou wouldeſt ſpeed for their own ſake. But <hi>faith</hi> layes theſe aſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, it hath <hi>motives from Gods own heart</hi> and <hi>mouth,</hi> with which it teacheth the ſoul to urge God, the <hi>Name of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>gracious goodneſſe of God himſelf,</hi> the <hi>fidelity of his promiſes, his own word;</hi> Now God hath ſaid, that theſe ſhall prevaile with him, and faith knows it to be infallibly ſo, and hereupon drawes on the ſoule with marvellous cheerfulneſſe to ſeek the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Know this, that <hi>no man ſhall in good earneſt ſet upon God for faith,</hi> and <hi>other grace,</hi> but <hi>Satan will ſet upon his heart,</hi> and <hi>his heart will ſet against his wayes in this.</hi> This were a wonder indeed, if a man could get into Chriſts armes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado: That he ſhould inſtantly have an heart (in all imaginable reſpects) ſweetly and totally framed with the ſtrength, and un-interrupted gales of heavenly inclinations and performances. Alas! poor ſoul, thou muſt by <hi>weak faith</hi> fight hard to <hi>get ſtrong faith,</hi> and thou muſt by <hi>any duty</hi> make way for clearer duty: well is it with thee, if inſtead of words, thou canſt ſometimes ſeek God with <hi>ſighs,</hi> and when ſighes
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115662:112"/> faile, if yet with <hi>groanes and deſires.</hi> When thou wouldeſt do <hi>good,</hi> thou ſhalt finde evil preſent with thee; when thou feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt an heart to pray, perhaps even that motion is almoſt ſtruck out by another heart in thee, which is moſt unwilling to pray; when thou feeleſt any climbings of thy ſoul by faith in thy heart, even theſe will be oppoſed by ſtrong doubtings and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions by another heart of unbelief within thee. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe remember this, that this particular oppoſition being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, diſliked, bewailed, doth only declare that there is in thee, that which is contrary to thee, and that <hi>Satan diſlikes thy way,</hi> it doth not teſtifie that <hi>God diſlikes it,</hi> or will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of thee.</p>
                  <p>If God hath given unto thee any deſires towards him, O cheriſh them as one would a ſpark; The beginnings of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian are in much weakneſſe, and manifold diſtractions and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, but <hi>there is a God</hi> who gave unto thee thoſe breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and can underſtand ſecret groans; and there is a Chriſt, who can and will make weak ſervices acceptable, and in time will give the <hi>victory</hi> after the combate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Many ſeekings,</hi> but <hi>nothing comes of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This doth exceedingly diſtract the ſoule, <hi>the unſenſible alteration of the ſoule after many ſeekings,</hi> uſually raiſe a <hi>prejudice againſt God</hi> and <hi>our ſelves,</hi> but for this obſerve ſome particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>efficacy of ſeekings,</hi> conſiſts not in the <hi>quantity</hi> or <hi>number,</hi> but in the <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>manner. Have you offered unto me Sacrifices and offerings in the wilderneſſe fourty years, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Amos 5. 25. So I ſay, haſt thou offered prayers unto God in theſe many dayes of thy diſtreſſes? nay, thou haſt come before him <hi>with words,</hi> but not with prayers.</p>
                  <p>What? thinkeſt thou that the Lord is pleaſed with all thy teares, and with all the humblings of thy Spirit, and with all the importunities of thy requeſts, whiles under them all, thou doeſt not ſtick to tell God to his face that he is a <hi>diſſembler</hi> and <hi>lyar?</hi> In all theſe thy ſacrifices and approaches unto the great and high God, thou didſt not believe any one promiſe which he hath made, thou haſt thought that God would not do thee good; and is it likely that thou ſhouldeſt ſpeed well at his hand, who reproacheſt the true and faithful God?</p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:115662:113"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> I do indeed <hi>pray, becauſe I muſt,</hi> I am commanded, but I verily beleeve it <hi>is in vaine;</hi> tuſh, what tell you me of Gods promiſes, he will never perform them to me?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Good God! what, ſhall the Lord not only command by a righteous word, but aſſure and invite by a good and faithful word, a word as true as truth it ſelf, and is it but a tuſh with us? is it not of any more account with us? nay, not of ſo much account as the word of a poore man? No marvel that nothing comes after many ſeekings, ſuch <hi>ſeekings of pride and unbelief,</hi> infidelity, for the pardon of which I adviſe thee to ſpeed up many more ſeekings of faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Right ſeekings ſhall alwayes come to ſomething;</hi> Though the proud and impatient perſons ſaid, <hi>It was in vaine to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord?</hi> Mal. 3. 14. Yet God aſſures them, that <hi>the day ſhould come that they ſhould returne and diſcern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not,</hi> Ver. 18. Sweet is that place of the Prophet <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>God is faithful who hath promiſed,</hi> and he <hi>will never ſuffer his truth to faile.</hi> If there be any good thing which he hath commanded thee to pray for, and which he hath undertaken for thee in his promiſes, and which thou doſt humbly ſue out in the name of Chriſt by faith; I ſay, reſt upon it, it ſhall be given to thee if thou canſt but wait on God in the uſe of the means.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>double anſwer to the ſeeking of the ſoul,</hi> one is real, another is ſenſible: As when a requeſt is preſented to the King, either for pardon or ſettling; if he accepts of the requeſt and puts his ſeale to the authorizing of the grant, the requeſt is really done though (perhaps) the petitioner knows it not: So it is with the Lord many times in his anſwerings, he doth the things really for us, though we be not preſently ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it: we beg for mourning hearts, and for hearts to hate ſinne, and for hearts to pray unto him, and then we feel our
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115662:113"/> hearts hard, and our corruptions burſting forth upon us, which makes our hearts bitterly to grieve, and ſtirres up extreame loathings of our vile natures, and cauſeth the ſoule to lie groveling with moſt ſtriving and ſervent importunities at hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven gate; Why, here are now the very things that we would have, yet we are not many times ſenſible that theſe things are anſwers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt diſtinguiſh 'twixt <hi>nothing abſolutely,</hi> and <hi>nothing comparatively.</hi> Why, it is true, that the Holy heart hath ſuch an extream abomination of ſinne, and ſuch an high thirſt of grace, that the preſent anſwers from heaven ſeeme as <hi>nothing</hi> (that is) there is yet ſomething more and more which I would have, the preſent grants are not ſatisfying of my deſires, yet <hi>ſomething is got</hi> by every faithful ſeeking; there is not one faithful prayer, which thou haſt diſpatched to heaven, but it delivers thy meſſage, and is returned with a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                  <p>Either it <hi>gets more additions to ſome grace or other,</hi> or <hi>more alienation from ſome ſinne or other,</hi> or more <hi>diſpotion to ſome duty or other,</hi> or more <hi>reſolution to ſeek, or more ſtrength to waite.</hi> Like the many Bees which go out, every one comes home with ſome thing, one with honey, another with wax; ſo every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prayer flies up to heaven and gathers ſomething or other from the good promiſes, and though not <hi>ſo much</hi> as thou <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</hi> yet alwayes <hi>more</hi> then thou <hi>deſerveſt,</hi> though not <hi>ſo much</hi> as to <hi>ſatisfie,</hi> yet as to help.</p>
                  <p>5. Suppoſe that yet you are not anſwered, it is then <hi>a ſinne to murmur</hi> and <hi>quarrel,</hi> but it is thy <hi>duty to wait.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I obſerve this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>God never gives thee ſo large an almes,</hi> but that thou needeſt the next houre to become a farther Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God is pleaſed to <hi>make the beggar to stay ſometimes at door;</hi> he doth not alwayes preſently give what he intends certainly to beſtow, but as his own <hi>free grace</hi> is the <hi>treaſury of our gifts</hi> and ſupplies, ſo his <hi>own wiſdom</hi> is the diſpenſor of the time and ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Now then, as the <hi>goodneſſe of the promiſe</hi> ſhould draw us to <hi>beleeve,</hi> ſo the <hi>fidelity</hi> and <hi>certainty of it</hi> ſhould cauſe us to

               <p>Beloved, there be two offices of faith.</p>
               <p>One is to breed <hi>conjunction</hi> and <hi>acceptance,</hi> and this is done when the heart is upon good, and choiſe, and deliberated grounds effectually inclined to content and take whole Chriſt upon his own terms.</p>
               <p>Another is to breed <hi>dependance,</hi> and this is done when the beleeving ſoul makes continued uſe of that fulneſſe and vertue which is in Chriſt touching the continued exigencies of its ſtate and condition in this life. As it is with a woman, ſhe firſt gives her conſent, and becomes a wife, and then being a wife, ſhe looks upon her husband as the onely perſon to ſupply her, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect her, comfort her, provide for her and hers.</p>
               <p>So is it with faith, firſt it doth eſpouſe the ſoule to Chriſt, it takes him as Lord and husband, and then it caſts all the proviſions of the ſoule upon him, all the ſupplies and helps, it truſts on him for righteouſneſſe, on him for pardon of ſinnes, on him for grace, one him for

               <p>Now becauſe this is a point of ſingular conſequence, give me leave therefore (and it matters not, if now and then I make a little digreſſion) to unfold theſe particulars, that you may the better underſtand and be aſſiſted, how to uſe that faith in Chriſt, which you have to live upon him by it.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. VVHat it is (in the <hi>general) to live by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I will not now ſtand on the ſeveral kindes and ſorts of life, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a life of vegitation which the trees and plants do live, and a life of ſenſe, which the beaſts and cattel do live; and that there is a <hi>life of reaſon</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> which man doth live; and that there is a life of faith which the Chriſtian either doth, or ſhould live.</p>
                  <p>Neither will I ſtand upon the oppoſition 'twixt the <hi>living by faith,</hi> and <hi>living by works,</hi> one being a legal life, and upon our ſelves; the other being an <hi>evangelical life,</hi> and upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Nor now of that oppoſition 'twixt the <hi>life of faith</hi> and the <hi>life of ſenſe,</hi> the one being a <hi>life in hand,</hi> the other <hi>in promiſes;</hi> That depending upon our <hi>eye,</hi> this upon our <hi>eare,</hi> (that is) <hi>ſenſe</hi> dwelling on what it can ſee, and <hi>faith</hi> on that good word which it doth hear.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being paſſed over, I conjecture, that to <hi>live by faith</hi> may be thus deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is an heavenly and dutiful committing of our whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">To live by faith, what.</note> 
                     <hi>and of our whole estates unto God, with a pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon his faithful and good promiſes in Chriſt, for ſutable and ſeaſonable ſupplies in all our exigences occurrences, and changes whatſoever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are divers things obſervable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to live by faith, is <hi>to commit all to God:</hi> It is as it were to intruſt him with our ſelves and ours. <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) whom I have beleeved, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 12. As if he ſhould ſay, I have put my very ſoul and life into the hands of Chriſt, who I know will look to it, take care of it for ever. <hi>David</hi> makes this to be the putting of our ſelves under God, as our <hi>Shepherd,</hi> Pſal. 23. 1. and as our <hi>Keeper,</hi> Pſalm. 121. 5. Mark this, a man lives not by faith when he undertakes to be himſelf, the Lord of himſelf, or a God to himſelf, when
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115662:115"/> he truſts to his own heart, or will ſubſiſt by his own arme, or when he puts his confidence in any arme of fleſh. O no, <hi>faith gives God the honour of our beings and ſafeties,</hi> and reſignes up all to be, and to be diſpoſed as the Lord pleaſeth; If he will have me to enjoy, well; if to want, well; if to abound, well; if to be abaſed, well; I would be as he would have me to be, and I would be eſtated as he would have me to be eſtated; If he thinks good to beſtow a faire eſtate upon me, I deſire to be <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>thankful;</hi> If he thinks good to limit me to a meane eſtate, I deſire to be humble and <hi>contented;</hi> If he keeps me in a free condition, I deſire to <hi>love him;</hi> if in a perplexed condition, I yet deſire to <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>ſerve him:</hi> though I would be careful and diligent, yet I would not be anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vexing; I dare to truſt him with my ſoul, to preſerve, ſanctifie, uphold, comfort, ſave it; I truſt him with my <hi>body,</hi> to preſerve, enable, change, and diſpoſe it; I truſt him with my whole <hi>eſtate,</hi> to give it, alte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it, increaſe it, leſſen it, keep it, bleſſe it, as may make moſt for his glory and my good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To live by faith, is to depend <hi>upon God for all.</hi> You all conjecture, That</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God is an <hi>alſufficient goodneſſe,</hi> he is goodneſſe it ſelfe; And whatſoever good the creature is capable of, or doth actually participate, he is the ſole cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; meanes which be next at hand and neare our eyes, are but pipes and ſtewards, but God he is the fountaine and Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>he hath put all Covenant good for his ſervants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to promiſes.</hi> The promiſes are nothing elſe but a deed of gift, ſealed with the truth of God: There hath God freely undertaken whatſoever belongs to grace or glory; to this life, or to that which is to come; doeſt thou want this or that, Why, whatſoever is fit for thee to have, that I promiſe in the Name of my Sonne to give unto thee, ſaith God.</p>
                  <p>Now to live by faith, is to caſt anchor at heaven gates, it is to caſt the ſoul upon Gods promiſes in Chriſt, to rely on God for any good which God hath promiſed, and undertaken; this I want, and this God hath promiſed; he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115662:116"/> the ſupply, and I will truſt upon him for it.</p>
                  <p>Though I feel no ſuch thing; nay, though I feel the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, yet I do not caſt away my confidence: <hi>Though fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees bloſſome not, though olives faile, and hindes are gone,</hi> yet if my ſupply appears in any word of promiſe, I take heart and ſay, yet my condition is good, all is well and ſure; My God hath undertaken it for me, and in his Word will I truſt, which is good and true, he will not faile me, I ſhall have what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is good, and that too in a good time: This only in general.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Sol.</hi> TO what <hi>ſtates the life of faith may extend.</hi> You know that there are two eminent ſtates of our life.</p>
                  <p>1. One is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> which reſpects all the exigencies, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, windings, turnings, changes, defections, eclipſes, tryals, and hardſhips of the ſoul: Whatſoever accidents may befall an holy ſoul about the heavenly condition, that appertaines to the ſpiritual ſtate; all the ſupplies of grace, of ſtrength, of comfort, of aſſurance, of aſſiſtance againſt temptations, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, troubles, all enlivements and quicknings of the Spirit about all ſorts of duties and ſervices, active or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
                  <p>2. Another is temporal, which is not onely the terme of our natural breathings, but alſo the ſundry and manifold oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences which befal us in the employments of our life; all the accidents, and interruptions, croſſings, checkings; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties, either in our bodies, or calling, or wealth, or perſons, or children, or ſervants, or good name.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, the temporal ſtate comprehends all whatſoever may weaken; or waſt, or diſtract: All or any of our temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, delights, deſires, ends; as alſo all our temporal ſupplements for the being, or well-being of this poore and ſhort life of ours, as health, ſtrength, friends, food,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115662:116"/> liberty, eſtate, peace, and quietneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now then living by faith extends to both: <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Prophet,</hi> Hab. 2. 4. of the Jews in the temporal ſtate; and, <hi>I live by the faith of the Sonne of God,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 2. ſpeaking of his ſpiritual ſtate.</p>
                  <p>So that faith bears up ſoul and body, and is both for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth: It ſerves to fetch in the blood of Chriſt, the redemption by Chriſt, pardon of ſinne, Gods favour, all grace and comfort to the ſoul: And it ſerves to fetch in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo health to the body, riches to the eſtate, plenty, peace, friends, what not? When I am ſick, I yet truſt in God for health, when poor, I yet truſt on God for ſufficiency, when under reproach, I yet truſt on God to clear my innocency, when under diſcomforts and forſakements, I yet truſt on God for favor and countenance: In all my diſtreſſes and reproaches, I have yet his Word for my ſupplies and helps, upon which I reſt, and thus I live by faith: ſo far as the promiſes extend, ſo far doth living by faith extend.</p>

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:115662:117"/>
                  <p> There is ſomething lyes upon us which ſhould not, and we cannot help our ſelves, and therefore we go abroad by faith; this is to live upon the market.</p>
                  <p>Now there are many things which ly upon our ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>ſenſe of guilt;</hi> this is a great matter, it makes the very heart oft-times to tremble; it is an heavy burden when a man ſinnes againſt an <hi>holy and juſt God,</hi> the leaſt of them provoking and damnable: This is a time of trouble, for a man ſees much in debt, and nothing in ſtock, he is not able to pay a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hing, all that he is or can do, can never anſwer divine Juſtice. This is one exigence now which makes a man capable to live by faith, to look out to Chriſt, and to try what he will do for him a miſerable ſinner, as you ſhall heare anon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſenſe of unrighteouſneſſe:</hi> Why, God requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>res an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conformity to his divine will, in heart, and in life, that our nature ſhould be as he requires, and our wayes as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but when the ſoul is able actively to reflect on it ſelfe, and look on God, and then to compare what it is and hath done, with what it ſhould be, and ſhould have done; It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at its own unrighteouſneſſe, and this is much increaſed, for it knows that no <hi>unrighteous perſon ſhall go to heaven;</hi> It knows that God will not pronounce unrighteous judgement; He will not acquit a man as righteous who hath not righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor ſhall he ever ſtand in judgement before him. Now this is another exigence which puts the ſoul upon the life of faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>times of deſertion,</hi> when all the comfortable eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Chriſtian ſtate are drawn off, as it were, when the Lord confines himſelfe and all to his promiſe: The poor ſoul hath no ſpark of comfort, it hath no glimpſe of divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, if it can finde God to be his God, and Chriſt to be its Chriſt in the promiſes, well and good, but there is no feeling, nor handling any ſenſible tokens. This is another exigence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The times of contrariety: when the Sunne ſeemes to be darkened, and when mercy ſeems to be angry, and when fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſeems to caſt off, when mindfulneſſe ſeemes forgetful, God ſeemes not to regard us, but to fight againſt us, and Chriſt who did call to us to come unto him, doth ſeem to go away from us:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115662:117"/> O this is a ſtrong exigence of the ſoule, and if ever, now muſt it live by faith.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>time of weakneſſe:</hi> when a man ſees that his work is great, and his ſtrength is ſmall duties many, power little, affections dull, not able to do for Chriſt, not able to ſuffer for Chriſt, cannot pray, hear, receive, obey as he ſhould, as he would. This is alſo an exigence of the ſoul wherein it needs to live by faith on Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>times of corruption:</hi> when a man feels ſinne afreſh, he had thought ſinne had been dead long ago, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts had been paſt, but now he perceives ſinne to riſe like an armed man, and like a flood, even ready to beare down the ſoule with that hideous inſolency, and violence of wicked thoughts and inclinations; yea, ſo great is this ſtorme, that as they ſaid to Chriſt in another caſe, ſo here, <hi>Maſter help, or elſe we periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The <hi>times of temptation,</hi> which like a croſſe winde, beares the ſhip almoſt under water: The gates of hell ſeems to open themſelves againſt the ſoul, and the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe fall in upon it with all the cunning of unbelief, and excitation to blaſphemy; To deny God, to ſlight his Word, to let go our confidence in Chriſt, ſo that the poore ſoul is almoſt brought to duſt and death by reaſon of them. This is alſo another exigence for the ſoul to make uſe of Chriſt, and to live by faith.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The <hi>times of contradiction:</hi> when the mouths of wicked and fooliſh men, like ſharp raſors, wound and cut off a mans good Name, when their hands, like claws of Lyons, teare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the prey, they take away the innocency of the upright, and the eſtates, liberties, friends, all the earthly encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the righteous; I ſay, this may alſo be an exigence, for the ſoul to live by faith in Chriſt, and to make up all in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
                  <p>2. Now, as he who lives by faith, is (in the acting of that life) ſtill ſenſible of ſome one of theſe exigencies or ſtraits of his ſoule; ſo in the ſecond place he muſt be able to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a ſutable fulneſſe in Chriſt;</hi> He muſt know two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that <hi>Christ hath enough in him to anſwer all theſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:115662:118"/>
                  <p> Secondly, that <hi>Chriſt is appointed of God, and willing to do it;</hi> therefore I pray you remember.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that <hi>Chriſt hath enough in him to anſwer all the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the ſoule:</hi> Thy ſoule cannot be caſt on any ſea, but he is there as a ſure ſhip and harbour; It cannot be caſt upon any ſtreight or trouble whatſoever, but Chriſt is able to relieve it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the ſenſe <hi>of guilt:</hi> Why, in this there is that in Chriſt which can take it off: <hi>His blood</hi> is good payment, and it was ſhed <hi>for the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> He can make perfect peace, and <hi>ſatisfie to the utmoſt:</hi> As the leaſt ſinne needs his me it, ſo the greateſt doth not exceed it: If Chriſt would but offer up his ſoul for thine, his merits for thy treſpaſſes, his precious blood for thy bloody crimes; Why, God will be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, for his blood is the blood <hi>of atonement of reconciliation,</hi> of blotting out, of peace, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So for <hi>unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> Why, there is that in Chriſt which can preſent the righteous unſpotted, unblameable; which can preſent thee glorious <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>He can finde an ample garment without any rent, an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which was perfect, which God will accept, for which he will juſtifie thee; Though <hi>thine own righteouſneſſe</hi> (for matter of judicial Juſtification) <hi>be as filthy rags.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The like may be ſaid in a proportion to <hi>all the other exigencies.</hi> Though thou be weak in grace, feeble in duty, yet he can make <hi>all grace to abound,</hi> and he can <hi>ſtrengthen the feeble knees,</hi> and he can <hi>comfort the mourning ſpirit,</hi> and he can open heaven againe: He can open thy eyes that thou ſhalt ſee thy God again; yea, and as thou haſt done formerly, as thy God, yea, he can conquer the buſieſt corruption, and put by thy ſtrongeſt temptation, and ſtand by thee in the bittereſt oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>2. Nay, and Chriſt is both <hi>appointed of God</hi> to be, and do all this for the beleever, and <hi>is very willing. He is made unto us of God,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.) <hi>wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption:</hi> therefore is he called the <hi>horn of ſalvation,</hi> the <hi>Juſtifier of his people,</hi> the <hi>Standard</hi> to which we ſhould repaire, the <hi>ſtrength of them that truſt in him,</hi> in a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115662:118"/> word, he was inveſted a Mediator with his triple office, of Prieſt, and Prophet, and King, to be, and to do all this for ſuch as are believers.</p>
                  <p>Thou doeſt not miſtake thy ſelf, nor miſconceive of God or Chriſt, when thou goeſt to the Lord Jeſus in any of thy ſtreits, then to be a Prieſt for thee, or to be a Prophet for thee, or to be a King unto thee. O no, God hath appointed him to be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of his body, to be the head of his Church, and Chriſt, who was thus ably inveſted, is as willing and faithful to diſcharge and performe.</p>
                  <p>3. Theſe things being to be known and granted, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the third place the <hi>conjunction of theſe two together,</hi> which indeed is the <hi>very living by faith upon Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>So againe, ſuppoſe that thou feeleſt corruptions ſtrongly working, and temptations grievouſly aſſaulting, now to live by faith on Chriſt is to come unto him, (knowing the Kingly power of his grace) and to beſeech him to ſubdue iniquities for
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115662:119"/> thee; and to ſend forth the rod of his Scepter, the power of his gracious Spirit, to mortifie thy luſts yet more, and to truſt upon him, that he will do this for thee, and therefore thou wilt apply thy ſelf, with patience and confidence to the uſe of all conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wayes and meanes, through which Chriſt will manifeſt that power unto thy ſoul. <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. As if he ſhould ſay, I am not able for my life to root out, to beat down theſe vile motions, but I caſt my ſelf upon Jeſus Chriſt, I truſt unto him, and verily beleeve he will deliver me; the like may be ſaid of all the other exigences, but I cannot repeat all.</p>
                  <p>Conſider that the habit or quality of faith is one thing, and the uſe or exerciſe of faith is another thing; the ſoul then lives by faith on Chriſt, when it improves its intereſt in Chriſt, when it can truſt to him to ſupply all its wants; a man is ſaid to live by bread, not when he hath it in his Cupboard, but when he takes and eates it; and a man is ſaid to live upon his money, not when he lets it to lie dead in his cheſt, but when he turnes and windes it for his benefit and ſupport. So here, to live by faith on Chriſt, is to put faith to work, my works are in my ſelf, but the ſupplies of my ſoul are in Chriſt; as I go to divine providence, and put my ſelf on its faithful powerful goodneſſe for my body, ſo I muſt go to the Lord Jeſus, and put my ſelf on his gracious and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fulneſſe for my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Yet obſerve a few things, for the clearer opening of <note place="margin">4. <hi>Things.</hi>
                     </note> this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To live by faith on Chriſt, it is more then <hi>a meere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of our wants,</hi> or an <hi>acknowledging of his fulneſſe.</hi> To ſee ſcarſity in the houſe, and plenty in the Market, this may be, and it may be vaine, unleſſe we go forth to fetch in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <p>Whiles the ſoul keeps home, it lives not by faith: <hi>The life of faith lies abroad:</hi> a man may have grace to ſee his wants, and yet he lives not by faith, till he can get out unto Chriſt. <hi>I will go to the Prophet, to the man of God,</hi> ſaid the woman who had a troubled ſpirit for <hi>her dead child:</hi> Yea, this recovered her child againe: <hi>If I can but touch the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hem of his garment I ſhall be whole, ſaid ſhe in the Goſpel;</hi> you muſt bring the pitcher to the well, if you will have water; and the childes mouth muſt be applied to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115662:119"/> the breaſt, if it would have milk; and the ſoul muſt go unto Chriſt, it muſt approach unto him, or elſe it is but a fruitleſſe trouble, it is not a living by faith on him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To live by faith on Chriſt, it is more then a meer going to Chriſt, though the motion of the ſoul out of it ſelf be required, yet that alone is not ſufficient. If I go to a man for to lend me an hundred pound, if either I will not ſpeak to him, or truſt him, this is labour loft; ſo, though we do addreſſe our ſelves to Chriſt for help, but will not truſt upon him for ſupply, this is not yet to live by faith. For,</p>
                  <p>The life of faith on Chriſt is raiſed by three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>his fulneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>his goodneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>his faithfulneſſe,</hi> and all theſe enduce the ſoul to truſt unto him: he is <hi>able enough; Ergo,</hi> I will truſt him; he is <hi>ready enough,</hi> therefore I will truſt him; he is <hi>faithful,</hi> and will certainly do me good, therefore I will truſt him. So that to live by faith, it is to live by truſt; one is ſaid to live by truſt, when he hath nothing from another, but his word, or his bond, I think him honeſt, or I have him faſt bound, therefore I will truſt him. Thou haſt the Word of Chriſt, and the Promiſe of Chriſt, which is a ſure truth, to which, if thou doeſt truſt, thou doeſt live by faith. If I feel and do not complaine, if I complaine and do not pray, if I pray and do not truſt, this is not yet to live by faith; ſo farre as I can truſt upon Chriſt, that he will ſupply and help my ſoul, ſo farre I do live by faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay, Thirdly, to live by faith, is not onely to <hi>trust upon Chriſt for ſupply,</hi> but it is to <hi>expect the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a great difference 'twixt the <hi>life of ſenſe,</hi> and the <hi>life of faith:</hi> Senſe is oppoſite to expectation; it is only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, what it hath, that makes it up, it lives upon no ſtock but that in hand, but faith reckons its eſtate more from what lies in bonds, then what the perſon findes in the purſe: It findes the greateſt part of the ſouls eſtate, yet in the promiſes, and yet in Chriſt, and in both graciouſly, and aſſuredly undertaken; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it doth make the ſoul not only to go to Chriſt, but to truſt him, and not only ſo, but to expect and waite patiently; <hi>he doth hear me,</hi> he will do me good, <hi>he will not ſuffer ſin to have dominion,</hi>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:115662:120"/> he will ſend <hi>forth the rod of his power,</hi> he will make <hi>all grace to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi> he will not <hi>leave nor forſake me,</hi> he will ſatisfie for me, his interceſſion ſhall be effectual, I ſhall yet feel the <hi>power of his death,</hi> the <hi>vertue of his reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to pray and not to truſt, ſo to truſt and not to expect, to truſt and then to murmur, to truſt and to untruſt, whiles we are ſpeaking, to get the ſoul to put it ſelfe upon Chriſt, and before we have done ſpeaking, to pluck of the ſoul againe, to deface our own fealing, to caſt away our confidence, this is ill, very ill.</p>
                  <p>It is true that the <hi>acts of faith</hi> are capable of <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> and alſo of <hi>oppoſition,</hi> one man may more confidently truſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and another leſſe; ſometimes the ſame man is more pure and high in the act of truſting, and ſometimes he hath much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do with his heart, to get it to roll it ſelf on Chriſt; but yet he doth do it againſt many feares, and againſt many corrupt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings; now he lives by faith, but then know it is an ill buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe inſtantly to reverſe the acts of faith, faint in it, or but to ſuſpect Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, either in his power, or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or truth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to live by faith on Chriſt, it is an <hi>extenſive work,</hi> it is to truſt on him, not for one thing only, but for every thing, which concerns the ſtate of the ſoul. The ſoul is a needy thing, naturally it is ſo, and ſo it is ſpiritually; either it needs grace, or more grace, or ſtrength, or comfort, or peace, or mercy, and pardon, ſomething or other it wants; now Chriſt is an <hi>adequate ſupply</hi> to the ſoul, he hath grace enough, and righteouſneſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and power enough, and peace, and plenteous redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Now then as our wants appear, or as they multiply, ſo muſt faith appear and abound in its acts, if we will be ſaid to live by faith.</p>
                  <p>I will be righteouſneſſe to thee ſaith Chriſt, and I will truſt upon thee for it ſaith faith; I will be ſanctification to thee ſaith Chriſt, and I will truſt upon thee for it ſaith faith; I will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to thee ſaith Chriſt, and I will truſt unto thee for that too, ſaith faith; yea, I will truſt upon thee to be my continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al propitiation, continual interceſſion, to be my continual ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and ſtrength, for more grace, for quickning, for comfort, for ſalvation, for all.</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:115662:120"/>
                  <p> Doth corruption work againe? and I will to Chriſt againe to ſubdue it, he will do it for me; doth Satan renew his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? and I will renew my addreſſes to Chriſt, who will againe (I truſt) <hi>bruiſe him under my feet;</hi> my comforts are gone, but I will to Chriſt, I will live upon him, he will come again and then my joy ſhall be full.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the life of faith, as it is a multiplied work, (for it makes the ſoul to live upon Chriſt for its manifold grace,) ſo it is a repeated work, it leads on the ſoul often and often even for the ſame kinds of ſupplies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> O ſaith the ſoul, I did go to Chriſt, and did beſeech him to rebuke Satan, and I truſted on him, and followed my ſuit, and found it ſo; but now Satan tempts again, now ſin works a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, now my heart is down again, dull, and dead, and feeble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſay to ſuch an one, <hi>to live by faith, is to keep houſe with Chriſt,</hi> it is to be a <hi>daily gueſt;</hi> it is to relie upon him, it is ſo often to come as we have need, it is to draw water often from the ſame fountain: As if Chriſt did ſay to a perſon, whatſoever thy ſoul needs, come to me for it, and whenſoever, yet come I will do it for thee, and the heart goes confidently to the Lord of its life, and hope of its ſalvation.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>If we conſider our own condition,</hi> this might put us upon the life of faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>life of faith is congruous to our condition:</hi> for what is our condition, but a depending being, ſuch a being as ſubſiſts upon, and by another?</p>
                  <p>Take us <hi>as creatures,</hi> and ſo we are but <hi>beames of light,</hi> which the ſunne lets forth, ſupports, contracts, drawes in; We are
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115662:121"/> like a glaſſe which God doth frame, and hold in his own hand, or elſe we cannot ſtand; or like the flowers, they muſt be ſet in the ground, and then watered, and fenced, or elſe they live not: our whole being, and working, and maintenance is from him that made us; <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, take us as <hi>new creatures,</hi> ſo ſhall we find that not only our natural breath, but our ſpiritual being, not only life, but grace too, depends not on him who hath it, but on God who gave it; Grace is a ſweet ſtreame, but that flowes and runnes ſtill, becauſe ſtill fed by a living ſpring. It is a fruitful branch, but that branch doth ſtand and bear, becauſe upheld and ſupplied by a more fruitful root: Hence is it that Chriſt is called the <hi>head,</hi> and we the <hi>members;</hi> he is called the <hi>root,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>neceſſity of our condition:</hi> our condition here below doth ſo ſhift, and vary, and faile, go and come, that if we do not live by faith, we cannot (honeſtly) live at all: <hi>Helpe failed me on every ſide</hi> ſaid <hi>David, all men forſook me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul: We know not what to do</hi> ſaid <hi>Jehoſaphat:</hi> God is pleaſed to call off all our comforts, to gather up into his own hands of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all our ſupports. It is with us many times as with a Ship laden, but on a ſudden broken to pieces, now the perſons of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt ſwim towards the ſhore, and to the rocks: So God doth daſh in pieces our lower confidences: he cracks a full e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, he ſeparates very friends; he gives not a heart to people to ſhew us compaſſions: and ſorrowes on all ſides poure in themſelves, a man hath nothing in all the world left him, but Gods bond, is word of promiſe.</p>
                  <p>So for the <hi>eſtate of the ſoul,</hi> it is frequently ſo clouded, ſo dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo checked, ſo diſtreſſed, ſo aſſaulted, that all the meanes under heaven do not relieve it, if the Lord doth not help, if Chriſt be not the rock, it cannot be delivered or ſupported.</p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:115662:121"/>
                  <p> Now in ſuch caſes, where the condition is wholly reduced to the promiſes, or unto Chriſt, there can be no living but by faith: The heart of a man is either broken with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire and griefe, or will break into the wayes of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if it lives not by faith in the caſes of all ſenſibe ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is <hi>only faith which can eſpy ſomething for the ſoul now: Who is he that ſits in darkneſſe and ſees no light, let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God?</hi> Iſa. 50. 10. Faith can ſee the ſtars in the thickeſt night of darkneſſe; there is nothing but faith, which can tell the ſoul of rich mercy in the times of greateſt ſenſe of exceeding guilt; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but faith which can finde out fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt for a ſoul which is bitterly ſenſible of its wonderful and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual emptineſſe. Till the Angel came and opened <hi>Hagars eyes to ſee the fountaine,</hi> ſhe gave up her child for dead, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we have faith to open our eyes to ſee the fountain of grace and mercy in God and Chriſt, I tell you that in many of our exigencies we ſhall throw away all, all as dead, and loſt, and hopeleſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againe, It is <hi>nothing but faith which gives ſpirit unto us from a bare promiſe:</hi> one word of God is ſecurity enough to faith. If a Marriner can get to the top of the Maſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry but a point of land, he is now glad, all is well; faith is ſaid to <hi>ſee the promiſes afar of,</hi> Heb. 11. well ſaith faith to the ſoul now, as <hi>Paul</hi> to them <hi>which ſayled with him, be of good cheer,</hi> thou ſhalt yet do well, grace, and mercy, and help will come, God hath promiſed it, and Chriſt will make all the <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Yea and Amen;</hi> and now the ſoul lives becauſe of that good and faithful word, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we conſider <hi>God himſelf,</hi> there is ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we ſhould live by faith.</p>
                  <p>There be ſix arguments which we may behold in God, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite <note place="margin">6. <hi>Things.</hi>
                     </note> and perſwade us to live by faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, his <hi>Alſufficiency, I am God alſufficient,</hi> ſaid he to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> What's that? That is, I am an abſolute and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent eſſence in reſpect of my ſelf, infinitely perfect and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and have enough and enough to ſatisfie all the world. Take all the particular creatures in the world and view into
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115662:122"/> their natures and conditions, you ſhall finde every one of them to be imperfect, to be depending, to be repleniſhed with wants: even one man for his own particular is covered over with innumerable wants, the wants of his ſoul are many, ſo of his body, ſo of his eſtate, what then, and how many are the neceſſities of every man? But now <hi>God is alſufficient</hi> (that is) he hath enough to ſupply every man; He can <hi>open his hand, fill every living thing. Thou openeſt thy hand</hi> (ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 145. 15.) and <hi>ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living thing,</hi> and he is able to <hi>make all grace abound,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8. He is <hi>rich to all that call upon,</hi> Rom. 10. 12. He is <hi>able to do</hi> (Eph. 3. 20.) <hi>exceeding abundantly above all we can ask or think. My God ſhall ſupply all your need according to his riches in glory by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 4. 19. The <hi>Sunne</hi> you ſee hath light enough for a whole world, and a <hi>fountaine</hi> hath water enough for a whole countrey; Why, all good is in God, both originally, and eminently, and cauſally, (that is) he is goodneſſe it ſelf, and all goodneſſe, fulneſſe, without want, ſtrength, without weakneſſe, holineſſe, without blemiſh, yea, and the univerſal cauſe of goodneſſe, and therefore infinitely able to ſupply, and help, and do good: there is no one neceſſity, but he is able infinitely to ſuccour it, and many, yea, all neceſſities are not to be compared to the unfathomed greatneſſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingneſſe of his fulneſſe and alſufficiency.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>His Command:</hi> As God is an abſolute and full good, (all our helps do center in him as in their compleat cauſe) ſo he hath commanded us to live upon his alſufficiency by faith. How often do you read thoſe charges, <hi>Truſt upon the Lord, commit thy way to the Lord, reſt upon him, ſtay upon the God of Jacob, caſt thy care on him.</hi> As if God ſhould ſay unto the ſons of men, I am he, and there is none elſe beſides me who can do you good; there is not any good in all the world which you want but I am able to ſupply it, I am alſufficient for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for holineſſe, for mercy, for power, for grace, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for peace. If you want water, you would go to the Spring, and if you want light, you would look up to the Sunne, and if you want any good, why will you not look up to me who am goodneſſe it ſelf? I tell you, that I am a God, and have the greatneſſe and the fulneſſe of a God; Nay, and I charge and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115662:122"/> require you, when you need any thing, come to me for it: I am the Maſter of all the families of the earth, and the Lord of all good; It is my expreſſe will, that you come unto me, and that you put your truſt on me, that you beleeve on my alſufficiency, that you live upon that ſtock which is in my ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Nay, I ſhall take it exceeding ill, if you reſt your ſelves, or live on any other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>His Promiſes:</hi> Conſider this two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Generally, <hi>his promiſes of good,</hi> wherein is ground to truſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Particularly, <hi>His promiſes to them that will and do truſt,</hi> Pſal. 37. 3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and verily, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 26. 3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee:</hi> So, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 13. This puts life to all the reſt, for though God were never ſo able to do good, and though his commands were never ſo urgent to live on him for all our good; yet if he had not made over this good unto us, we might maintain ſecret feares and diſcouragements. But now God hath promiſed all good unto us, (that is) he hath firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and graciouſly made it over; As if he ſhould ſay, all the good that I can do, I will do it for thee; all the ample ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in me, is to repleniſh thee, it is to ſupply thy wants and neceſſities; and I aſſure thee in the Word of a God it is ſo. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 84. 11. <hi>The Lord is a Sunne and ſhield, the Lord will give grace and glory, no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, bleſſed is the man that trusteth in thee.</hi> There is not any one particular want (which is fit to be ſtiled a want, and fit to be ſupplied in this life, for ſoul) but God hath by promiſes particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged all his ſufficiency to help and ſupply it. Doeſt thou want an <hi>holy heart,</hi> a <hi>returning heart,</hi> an <hi>heart to hate ſinne,</hi> to <hi>mourn for ſinne,</hi> a <hi>beleeving heart,</hi> an upright heart, a meek and patient heart, a joyful heart? doeſt thou want any grace, more grace, pardon of ſin, aſſurance of pardon, ſtrength againſt ſin, ſtrength for any duty, active, or paſſive? wanteſt thou any convenient and fit good for thy body, for thy name, for thy eſtate, for thy children, for thy family? any good for life, at death, after death? Not any one of theſe which God hath not diſtinctly promiſed. If you knew a man to be ſufficient,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115662:123"/> to have an eſtate worth ten thouſand pounds, and all free, you will preſently truſt him for an hundred pounds, or if ſuch an one ſhould command any in his need to come to him, and borrow, this would draw many to him; but if he ſhould take a man out particularly, and ſay to him, Friend, my eſtate is thus great, I have a great eſtate, and I pray thee if thou need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt any thing at any time, repaire to me, I give thee my word, and if that be not enough, thou ſhalt have bond and ſeale that I will help thee; it were enough, he needed not to ſay more, he will to him I warrant you. Thus ſaith the Lord to a beleever, to one who hath accepted of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith God to him, I tell thee by my Word, (which is truth it ſelf and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie, nor deceive) that I am a great God, alſufficiency, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is in me in infinite perfection, and I am able to do thee any good; now my will is, that thou ſhouldeſt come unto me at any time, in any of thy diſtreſſes, and I do promiſe thee, that I will not with-hold any good thing from thee; As true as I am God, I wil not leave thee nor forſake thee; ſhould not this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to live by faith?</p>
                  <p>4. His <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ability;</hi> as we want much good, ſo God doth undertake all good: And this is another encouragement, that God never over engageth himſelf; he is able to make good all his underſtandings: Many a man is undone by ſuretiſhip, he ſuffers himſelf to be bound beyond his ability; it is not ſo with God.</p>
                  <p>This is granted, that at the leaſt a proportionable power is neceſſary to give being to all promiſes and undertakings, <hi>goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>kindneſſe</hi> are enough to make a promiſe but <hi>ability</hi> is alſo required to make good that promiſe. If a ſubject pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to releaſe, or pardon a Malefactor, why, this is nothing, he is not to be truſted; why? becauſe he hath not power of life or death; if a poore man promiſe to diſcharge a debt of four hundred thouſand pounds; why; no man will truſt to his undertakings: why? becauſe he hath no ability, he hath not an eſtate anſwerable, he is not able to pay twenty ſhillings; ſo that power gives ground to <hi>truſting,</hi> becauſe power is a neceſſary ingredient to all.</p>
                  <p>Now then, God hath ability enough to make good all or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his promiſes.</p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:115662:123"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> You will ſay, his <hi>promiſes</hi> are <hi>many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, as our needs are many, ſo his promiſes are many; But then, as his <hi>promiſes are many,</hi> ſo his <hi>goodneſſe is great,</hi> and his <hi>power infinite;</hi> now an infinite goodneſſe, and an infinite power, are able to make good, not only many, but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite promiſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay; that the things promiſed are great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I confeſſe they are, God hath undertaken great matters to pardon great ſinnes, to convert great ſinners, to conquer great temptations, to convey great conſolations, But is he not a great God? <hi>Is any thing too hard for him? nothing is impoſſible with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, that particular wants ſtill increaſe, and renue themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> So they do, as the veſſels which we fill to day, require a new filling to morrow, and the ſtomacks which we ſeem to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie now, within few houres they are empty and craving: But then, though the veſſel may be dry, yet the fountaine is not, though the veſſel may be empty, yet the fountaine is full and ſtill ſtreaming. As Gods goodneſſe is a living fountain, ſo his promiſes are a perpetual bond; They are continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, and depend upon an unexhauſted and infinite depth of goodneſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. 3. <hi>O houſe of Jacob, which art borne by me from the belly, and carried from the womb.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>Even to the old age I am he, and even to hoary haires, I will carry you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But yet you will ſay, yea, but God is engaged to ſo many, there is not a beleever, but God hath bound himſelf by many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I confeſſe, with man often-times this is ſomething; He hath but a particular ability, and therefore may overſhoot himſelf by general engagements; But with God it is not ſo, in whom power and ability to make good what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, is not contracted, broken limitted, depending, but ample, illimitted, and alſufficient from himſelf. Therefore he is ſaid to <hi>reſerve mercy for thouſands,</hi> and his promiſes runne to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and to all his ſeed.</hi> Why, the <hi>power of God,</hi> by which he is able to make good all his promiſes; It is a <hi>creating power,</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:115662:124"/> ſuch a power as can (upon the pleaſure of his will) command things into being; and it is an <hi>over-topping power,</hi> God alone can command our helps, he needeth not the aſſiſtance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to make good his undertakings; and it is an <hi>enduring power,</hi> it abides for ever, <hi>His hand is never ſhortned, that it cannot ſave. Is the Lords hand waxed ſhort</hi> (ſaid God himſelf to <hi>Moſes?</hi> Numb. 11. 23.) <hi>thou ſhalt ſee now whether my word ſhall come to paſſe or not.</hi> So then, as God hath enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelfe to do us good, ſo he is able enough to make that good.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>His fidelity</hi> and truth: As the promiſes, ſo the <hi>matter of them are full of goodneſſe:</hi> ſo for the <hi>forme of them,</hi> they are ſealed with truth: <hi>God who cannot lie hath promiſed,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 2. <hi>and it is impoſſible for him to lie,</hi> Heb. 6. 18.</p>
                  <p>Truth and fidelity may be conjectured to conſiſt in three things, I ſpeake now of them as applied to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In <hi>reality of intention:</hi> where the declaration is a faire letter, and the intention is a blur, when that is large and this is nothing; this may be a complemental lie, but it is not truth; the expreſſion muſt be but the intention, cloathed in words; It muſt be the purpoſe of the heart tranſcribed, if we will ſtile it truth and fidelity. Now when God promiſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good to a beleever, this is not <hi>vex &amp; praeteria nihil:</hi> a meer ſhowre of eloquent and comfortable words; O no, it is his will, and intention, and very purpoſe made known: He doth indeed intend that good which he undertakes, and ſpeaks of in his promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a <hi>conſtancy of reſolution:</hi> As <hi>falſhood</hi> is placed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in preſent <hi>incongruities,</hi> (when heart and tongue are at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) but alſo in <hi>ſubſequent inconſtancies:</hi> As when, though my preſent intention and expreſſion were parallel, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, like a rotten bottome which ſlips aſide from the houſe, ſo my heart breaks away from it ſelf, it becomes <hi>an heart, and an heart,</hi> as in <hi>Sauls</hi> promiſe to <hi>David,</hi> which changed preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c. On the contrary is it with truth, and in particular with Gods truth about his promiſes to beleevers; His word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe doth anſwer his purpoſe at firſt (for as he thought and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115662:124"/> ſo did he ſpeak) and that purpoſe ſtill anſwers it ſelf, and therefore he hath <hi>ſworn by himſelf, that he will not alter the thing that is gone forth of his lips: My Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt,</hi> Pſ. 89. 34 28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In a <hi>certainty of execution:</hi> As when a perſon hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to lend, or give an hundred pounds, he being free to take his own time; comes and layes it down, and ſaith, Lo here is the money which I promiſed to lend or give, take it; this is fidelity or truth. Such a truth is there in Gods promiſes: This is not all the truth of them, that for certain God hath ſpoken ſuch good things, but further, that he will aſſuredly performe them: <hi>Behold the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will perform that good thing which I have promiſed unto the houſe of Iſrael, and to the houſe of Jacob,</hi> Jer. 33. 14.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>His performance of them to them that have lived by faith.</hi> When perſons have committed themſelves and their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto him; when they have truſted upon his word, he hath not failed them, he hath made it good. <hi>Abraham,</hi> he did live <hi>by faith,</hi> when <hi>God promiſed him a Son,</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>that he did beleeve, he did not conſider his own body, but gave glory to God,</hi> n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reſting upon the ſole goodneſſe, fidelity, and ſtrength of his promiſe, and God did indeed perform the ſame unto him. Not any of the <hi>Kings of Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> but expreſſely ſped well, when in their exigencies they did truſt unto God. <hi>Our fathers trusted in thee, and thou didſt deliver them, they truſted in thee, and were not confounded.</hi> Pſal. 22 4, 5. <hi>The Lord is my strength and my ſhield, my heart truſted in him and I was helped,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> Pſal. 28. 7. <hi>The Lord ſhall help them, and deliver them,</hi> (ſpeaking of the righteous) <hi>and ſave them, becauſe they truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 37. 40. Now put all together, ſhould we not live by faith, truſt upon God in Chriſt (and through, and for Chriſt) for all our helps of ſoul, who is, 1. An alſufficient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. 2. Who commands us in unto himſelf for our helps. 3. Who hath promiſed all good unto us if we will but truſt him. 4. Who is able enough to make good whatſoever he promiſeth. 5. Who cannot, and will not lie, deceive or faile us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. Who hath given teſtimony of his truth in all ages, <hi>Who hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his oath to Jacob,</hi> and <hi>remembred his mercy to Abraham, who hath been ever in all ages mindful of his Covenant to ſuch</hi>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:115662:125"/> as durſt by ſaith live upon him and truſt in him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider the <hi>qualities of this life of faith,</hi> and theſe may much prevaile with us to labour to live upon God in Chriſt by faith.</p>
                  <p>There be foure ingredients in this kinde of life, all which are admirable, and indeed they are peculiar priviledges of it.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. It is the only Chriſtian life.</item>
                     <item>2. It is the only comfortable life.</item>
                     <item>3. It is the only getting and thriving life. <note place="margin">Four excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this life.</note>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. It is the only certain and ſtedfaſt life.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. The <hi>life of faith,</hi> it is the <hi>only Christian life.</hi> The Chriſtian hath a life common with many creatures, his life of eating and drinking, of nouriſhing and growth; it is ſuch a life, as the beaſts live as well as he: his life of reaſon and labour, that alſo is ſuch a life which all men live as well as he; but thee life of faith, that is ſingular and proper to the beleever; for no man hath that faith which the true beleever hath; and no man hath his eſtate ſo in heaven, ſo in Gods hands, ſo inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and treaſured in the Covenant of promiſes, as he. What <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake to his Diſciples about this very matter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 31. <hi>Take no thought, ſaying, what ſhall we eat? or what ſhall we drink? or wherewith ſhall we be cloathed?</hi> Ver. 32. <hi>For after all theſe things do the Gentiles ſeek:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, it is enough for meer ſinners, for ſuch as have not God to be their God, who cannot in Chriſt call him Father, it is enough for them to lead ſuch a vexing and diſtruſtful life. That I ſay here, Why, it is enough for men of this life, the men of this world, for them who have their onely portion here, to live the life of ſenſe, to be ſcraping, to be plodding, to be vexing their thoughts and hearts, how to compaſſe, how to fetch in, how to lengthen an eſtate; To have a God, and yet to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, a Chriſt, and not to live upon him, as if either were nothing in this Chriſtian; But for the beleever, who hath a God, and a Chriſt, and all good undertaken for him by a full and faithful Covenant; It is his life now to truſt upon his God, to rely upon his Saviour, to quiet himſelf in Gods Word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake in another caſe, <hi>If you love them that love you, and if ye do good to them that do good unto you, what ſingular</hi>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:115662:125"/> 
                     <hi>thing do you? do not even the Publicans and ſinners the ſame?</hi> That I ſay in this caſe, if ye will make up your own eſtate, if ye will live upon what you ſee, and what you taſte, and what you handle, and go not above, and beyond theſe and your ſelves; do not ſinners, do not the worſt of ſinners do the ſame? If the vileſt perſon can rejoyce when his table is full, and hang down his head when ſenſibles go off; wherein doth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever exceed him, who is merry and cheerful only in a ſenſible plenty, and his heart is ready to break in the ebbe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of that, by the dayes or years of ſcarſity and ſenſible diſtreſſe? If thou didſt look upon God as thy Father, and Chriſt as thy plentiful redemption, and the promiſes as a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly portion, and thine inheritance; then the dayes of tears to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, would be houres of thankfulneſſe unto thee; and the nights of fears to others, would be times of ſweet repoſe and contentment unto thee: When the ſpiders web was ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet thou couldeſt ſee the houſe ſtanding and ſure; even in all ſenſible abſtractions of the <hi>olive,</hi> and <hi>vine,</hi> and <hi>ſtalles,</hi> thou couldeſt yet <hi>rejoyce in the God of thy ſalvation.</hi> For <hi>the place of thy defence is the munition of rocks, bread ſhall be given unto thee, and thy waters ſhall be ſure,</hi> Iſaiah 33 16.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve a threefold difference 'twixt an unbeleever and a beleever.</p>
                  <p>One is <hi>in the very estate:</hi> for the beleever hath a far better portion then the unbeleever; he hath a portion ſet out for this life, and a portion alſo for a better, he hath food for his body and grace for his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Another is in the <hi>manner of ſettling the eſtate:</hi> for general providence relieves the one, and ſpecial affections provides for the other.</p>
                  <p>The one is helped by common goodneſſe of univerſal kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the other is undertaken for, and ſecured by a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bond of Covenant. God hath made over himſelf and all his goodneſſe unto him in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt: He hath taken upon himſelf all the care, and all the good, and only wills the beleever to be upright, and diligent, and ſo to truſt upon him; he hath ſettled all his grace, and ſtrength, and comfort in Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:115662:126"/>
                  <p> A third is in the manner of managing: The unbeleever, he will, like the prodigal, have all the eſtate into his own hands, he will truſt upon himſelf, he dares not ſettle on God, for he feares him, he ſuſpects him, he thinks verily God will not do him good, but he will faile: But the beleever <hi>knows whom he hath truſted,</hi> God is his God; and hath undertaken for him, and he <hi>who hath promiſed is faithful who will alſo do it:</hi> Now <note place="margin">Paul.</note> though I have not in hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I have in promiſe, though I have not in the coffer, yet I have in the bonds; my eſtate is even all that is good for me, and it lies in a ſure hand, in the hand of my good God who will not faile; Hereupon I live, to this I truſt, though others vex, and fret, and curſe, yet I ſit down quietly; Why? becauſe faith goes about what we ſee, and it is able to ſee the eſtate large enough, though lying in divine promiſes; and this is to live like a Chriſtian, for this is to acknowledge a God, and a Chriſt to ſome purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>life of faith,</hi> it is the <hi>only comfortable life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is with our life, as it is with fire, which if it burnes faire and clear, then is it pleaſant and delightful, but if it be dull and ſmoking, it makes us weary both of it, and the roome. Whiles faith doth guide our lives, (by ſettling our thoughts and deſires on God and Chriſt) then the lamp is cleare, life feels like life, we can pray with joy, and hear with delight, and follow our callings with cheerfulneſſe, and lie down in peace; But if you ſever faith from the life, that we dare not to truſt on God, nor reſt on Chriſt; we muſt poſſeſſe, or elſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truſt nor live; Now the chimney ſmoaks, the ſoul becomes diſpleaſing to it ſelf; the ſoul craves help from the body, and the body from the ſoul, but neither is able to help either, and therefore that is wanting, and this is vexing. The waves now get over the ſhip, and ſinks it with a load and deluge of worldly, endleſſe, fruitleſſe, anxious, vexing cares, and feares; And in ſober-ſadneſſe tell me, what you think of ſuch a life, wherein the <hi>head</hi> is diſturbed and curiouſly tortured with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of manifold, and exquiſite ſuſpitions, and thoughts, and the <hi>heart</hi> is deeply racked with the continual breakings of trembling ſighes and griefes? That a man is not able to get, nor yet patient to want, he can neither give himſelf help, nor will he truſt him who can; That his eſtate is burdened, with
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115662:126"/> many wants, and all this is made unſpeakably grievous by another worſe burden of unbeleeving thoughts; that a man ſees he cannot beare, and yet will not eaſe his ſhoulder by truſting. That a man cannot begin to think, but his thoughts throw him into a way of what ifs? What if the Lord will not do me good? what if I cannot have that? what if ſuch an one faile? or, what if it comes not on ſuch a day? &amp;c. So that he cannot think without tumults; nor ſpeak without diſcontents, nor eat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſlike, nor walk without ſlaviſhneſſe, nor work without diſtruſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ulneſſe, nor ſleep without terrours, nor awake without bitterneſſe, nor riſe without carefulneſſe; and amidſt all this, he hath no heart to duty, nor no God, nor to heaven, nor earth, nor to Chriſt, nor to himſelf, nor his; for either he hath no faith, or elſe will not live by it: He dares not truſt God, or Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>There be three things which concur to make the life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is a <hi>ſenſe of want:</hi> A man hath an extreame feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of need, no ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, or ſlight ſenſe, availe not to break our ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another is a <hi>ſtrong deſire,</hi> the heart pants and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the ſupply, and this multiplies thoughts and cares.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third is palpable <hi>inſufficiency;</hi> that a man cannot for his life compaſſe his deſires and ſupplies, and therefore like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> who was impeached for <hi>Naboths vineya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

The other is the earthly burden: The burden of guilt, and the burden of cares: But ſaith (if a man could live by it) takes them both off: It lives upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the one, and upon Gods providence for the other: It ſees a ſufficiency and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted price in his blood to remit our guilt, and it ſees an alſufficient, careful, faithful providence to remove our care: And I tell you, that the ſoule comes to great eaſe which is releaſed of both theſe: <hi>Sonne, be of good comfort, thy ſinnes be forgiven thee.</hi> Sinne ſhall be diſcharged, therefore I am comfortable; cares are gone, therefore I am cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It <hi>ſecures againſt all prejudices,</hi> and why? becauſe it ſtates the perſon in goodneſſe it ſelfe, in him who is nothing but goodneſſe, (that is) who is in reſpect of himſelfe good, and who will order all things for good to the Beleever, nay, and in his hands who is an abſolute Lord.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that one change in our eſtate may be contrary to another, and becauſe we eſteeme one of them to be good, therefore we judge the other to be evil: but then, though changes be oppoſite in ſenſe, yet they are concordant in iſſue, in the event all falls out for good: As ſickneſſe, though op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to health, yet it may fall out for the further preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life; ſometimes the Chriſtian is high, ſometimes low, ſometimes he is in a freed ſtate, ſometimes in a clouded ſtate; ſometimes he is in conqueſt, ſometimes he is in conflict; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is oyled in the mouths of men, and ſometimes tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and torne in pieces, as if the tongues of Chriſtians were the teeth of Lions: <hi>(Paul</hi> gives a Catalogue of his changes in theſe and the like caſes;) yet in all and after all, the Chriſtians condition is not prejudiced, God ſtill owns the perſon, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his ſafeties; Keeps all poyſon from the heart, and like a ſhip (ſometimes by a fair winde, ſometime by a rough ſtorm) he ſtill brings him ſafe to harbour. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake even of <hi>his bonds,</hi> that <hi>they fell out to the furtherance of the Goſpel;</hi> So I ſay of the calamitous occurrences, the ſenſe ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but miſery, yet faith can ſee the <hi>good end which God</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:115662:127"/> 
                     <hi>made with</hi> Job, and therefore to rejoyce in troubles.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It makes <hi>the preſent condition good, and enough.</hi> I will tell you one reaſon why the life of ſenſe is uncomfortable; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it is grounded on a ſhort and empty good; that which a man can ſee with his eye, and hold in his hand, is not halfe of that which he can deſire with his heart, no worldly thing can ever be enough to an unbelieving heart. But faith makes the ſoul well pleaſed, becauſe it preſents the ſoul with ſuch a good, as cannot only ſatisfie, but alſo exceed it. God is an infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; he, who can ſatisfie more then a world, may well content one mans heart; and Gods favour is a ſatisfying good, <hi>(I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy favour,</hi> ſaid <hi>David;)</hi> and to this doth faith entitle, yea, this it doth reveale to the ſoul; And I will tell you one thing, that he who cannot be contented with a God, and his favour; with a Chriſt, and his blood; with a Covenant, and its fulneſſe; he will never be content with any thing: if alſufficiency be not enough to thee, when can emptineſſe and vanity pleaſe and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee. What if a man hath but a little Garden, yet if he hath a large Parke, and ten thouſand Acres of Arables, and the Kings royal favour to grace all this? I tell you this would ſparkle his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it would breath a well-pleaſedneſſe in him. Thou complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that thou haſt but little of earthly things, I grant it, and a little may be enough: (enough depends more on quality, then quantity) but then, though the Garden be but ſmall, yet the Park is large; though thy portion in externals be not ſo great, yet this with a great and all ſufficient God, and a bleſſed Saviour, and a heaven to boot, is enough, and enough. If the wife ſaith ſhe hath but a ſmall joynture, yet if ſhe hath a rich and tender hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe is to be blamed if ſhe ſaith ſhe hath not enough: Faith viewes the Chriſtians eſtate, not as it is in its hand, but as in her husbands hand, in Chriſts, and then all is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>

                  <p>Profit is that which moſt men look upon, it is the cry of moſt, <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> and faith hath a ſingular art of getting. I obſerve that the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>od of a Chriſtian, in ſome reſpect, hangs in the promiſes, as water doth in the clouds; and look as the boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous windes rather drive away the clouds and rain, (though a few drops may ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So the only way to drive away the promiſes, (as it were) to remove them with their bleſſings, is not to believe, not to truſt, and the only way to make them to yield out their precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, is to believe, to live by faith: Take a place for either, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſoul oft-times bitterly complaines, that as yet it hath not that good thing, it ſticks yet in the hands of God, Chriſt can do it if he will. Why; but if ever thou wouldeſt ſpeed, thou muſt truſt; I dare not truſt though, ſaith the ſoul, how then canſt thou ſpeed? Why then doeſt thou complaine; God and Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes thy good; but then he requires this of thee, do but truſt me for it and thou ſhalt ſpeed, I will not fail thee, <hi>I have ſworne by my ſelf that I will not alter, nor repent.</hi> The poor man comes to Chriſt and cries out for help, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if thou canſt do any thing, &amp;c.</hi> Why; ſaith Chriſt, I can do any thing, I am able enough, and willing enough, that's not the thing, this is it which will make thee to ſpeed; canſt thou believe, dareſt thou to truſt upon me? he anſwered <hi>Lord I believe,</hi> I do truſt, and you know that his <hi>ſon was preſently healed.</hi> The childe comes to the father, father ſupply me, I will ſaith the father; but I will have it inſtantly; if he had asked and truſted his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he might have ſped, but becauſe he doth ask and murmur with his father, he is therefore juſtly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>There are two things which mightily oblige a perſon to the doing of a kindneſſe; one is <hi>his own promiſe,</hi> another is <hi>his friends confidence,</hi> who hath upon the ſecurity of his word adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured; ſo here, beſides the very inclination of the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to make good its own undertakings, this alſo adds not a little to our ſpeed, and furtherance, that we rely onely on God. It is a common complaint, that we cannot be anſwered: I reply, it is a common fault, that God nor Chriſt can be truſted. It is not how many wants thou feeleſt, nor how many promiſes thou readeſt, nor how many prayers thou makeſt; If with all this thou doeſt <hi>not ask in faith,</hi> think not (O man) to receive any thing from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>I will give you three reaſons why the life of faith is the only way to thrive.</p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:115662:129"/>
                  <p> Firſt, becauſe it <hi>puts a man upon the only way of bleſſings.</hi> As none can bleſſe but God, and he can bleſſe; ſo the bleſſings of God are to be expected only in the wayes of God, and nothing ſo skilful in Gods wayes as faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>it makes all the promiſes to yield:</hi> It is true, as God is infinitely above all, and his power is grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; ſo faith (in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified ſenſe) is above God himſelf; he is not able to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: <hi>Be it to thee as thou wilt, ſaid Chriſt to the believing wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: Thou ſhalt have the deſires of thine heart,</hi> ſaid <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 37. 3. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>God himſelfe, and Christ, and all, become ours,</hi> If we dare to truſt and live by faith: Thou wants outward ſupplies, I require no more of thee ſaith God, but to walk uprightly and diligently, and to truſt on me, and thou ſhalt have it: Thou wants ſpiritual ſupplies for thy ſoul; I require no more of thee but to come to me, to truſt to me, and go to my Ordinances; ſtand in my wayes and thou ſhalt have them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>it is the only ſtedfaſt and abiding life;</hi> when other lives are broken and cruſhed, they are gone down, yet this life by faith (like the Starres which ſhine in the night) remaines firme, I will clear it by Argument; The ſtability of all ſorts of lives is according to their principles and motives. The life which depends upon a failing cauſe, it is a fadeing life, and the life which depends upon a conſtant cauſe, is a conſtant life.</p>
                  <p>Now the life of faith is bred by a living principle, and is fed by conſtant and abiding motives; you know that the grounds of this life of faith, are in God and Chriſt, and the promiſe; now all changes reach not to them, our changes are below in other things, but they are not in the promiſes, nor in God above; as changes are not in the heavens, but in the aire. Look upon things at hand, and ſo they appeare with variety, and with much unlikeneſſe, but eye them in the Covenant, in the Promiſes, there you have the ſame faithful God ſtill, tender father ſtill, all ſufficient Saviour ſtill, the <hi>Promiſes are yea and Amen,</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>everlaſting father,</hi> the <hi>Covenant of God,</hi> an <hi>everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Gods love and immutable love, he is as able ſtill, as willing ſtill, <hi>his how abides in ſtrength, and underneath are his everlaſting armes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:115662:130"/>
                  <p> Though <hi>Davids father and mother forſake him, yet the Lord will take him up;</hi> and though <hi>all forſook Paul, yet God ſtood by him:</hi> ſo true is it that faith can caſt a ſure Anchor in all ſtates and in all changes, it can look upon the ſame God, and the ſame Chriſt, and the ſame promiſes, Though the Marriners, when they put to ſea, quickly loſe ſight of Land, yet they never looſe ſight of heaven; how far ſoever they ſaile, and in what tempeſt ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet ſtill they may look upon the heaven, the ſame hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>Faith never loſeth ſight of its rock, of its ſalvation, of its helpes; that which it eyes, it may eye for ever; and that upon which it truſts, it may truſt upon for ever; thou haſt friends, and this ſprings up thy ſpirit; thy friends dye, and now thy ſpirits ſink; thou haſt parents; and children; in theſe thou rejoyceſt, and ſettleſt thy confidence: both the one and the other embrace the duſt, and thy heart is utterly broken for help and comfort, O Lord what have I more. <hi>E contra,</hi> thou haſt a God, and he is the ſame for ever, a Chriſt, and he <hi>yeſterday, to day, and the ſame for ever: Promiſes,</hi> and they are a word ſetled forever in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; But when all ſenſibles flie off, yet if we live by faith we are at no degree of loſſe; what can he lack; who hath him, who is all in all, and what can he loſe, who hath him that knows no change at all?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let us conſider <hi>Jeſus Chriſt himſelf;</hi> There are diverſe things which ſhould perſwade us to live by faith upon him.</p>
                  <p>There are nine things in him which may move us.</p>

                  <p>God did purpoſe him, and intend him, and ſent him, and he came for this very end to do us good, and to help us in time of need, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>He gave him to be the head over all things to the Church. ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Which is his body, the fulneſſe of him that filleth all in all</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Head</hi> (you know) is a thing for office, and the offices of it is both <hi>dominion</hi> and <hi>influence;</hi> for theſe was Chriſt given to the Church to rule the Church, and to ſupply the Church. 1 Cor. 1. 30. <hi>He is made unto us of God, wiſdome, and righteouſneſs, and Sanctification, and redemption.</hi> Heb. 7. 22. <hi>He was made a ſurety of a better teſtament.</hi> Joh. 6. 27. <hi>Him hath God the father ſealed.</hi> Iſai. 61. 1. <hi>The Lord hath anointed me to preach good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:115662:131"/> 
                     <hi>unto the meek. He hath ſent me to binde up the broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to proclaime liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt, you will grant that he is an able Prieſt, and an able Prophet, and an able King, he is ſufficient enough to pacifie by his Blood, to purifie by his Spirit, to conquer by his Word; yea, but then conſider yet further, that he is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God to be this, and to do this for the believer. If the King commits a mighty ſtock to a mans hands, and ſets him in the place of a treaſurer, and confirmes him by ſeal, and all for this very end, that he ſhould ſupply ſuch and ſuch perſons, would they not come unto him for their ſupplies?</p>
                  <p>Thou art never able to be <hi>righteouſneſſe to thy ſelf,</hi> thou art never able to <hi>give grace</hi> unto thy ſelf, thou art never able to <hi>give ſtrength</hi> to thy ſelf; but Chriſt is, and God is, even that God to whom thou doeſt ſo earneſtly cry, he hath ordeined his own Son for thy help, even for thy help. As if the King ſhould ſay to a poor man petitioning; Why; Go to my Treaſurer, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him order for thee; ſo the Lord to the beleever, Go to my ſonne, I have ordained him to give thee grace, I have ordained him to plead thy ſuits, to rule thy heart, to conquer thy ſinnes; and thy temptations, I ſent him into the world for that very end and purpoſe, that he might be all in all unto thee, I purpoſed his blood for thee, and his righteouſneſs, and his fulneſs, and his interceſſion, all for thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>His ſervices,</hi> what he hath done in the behalf of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave in this a little, and you ſhall ſee what reaſon we have then to truſt upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, though he was <hi>equall with God,</hi> yet <hi>made he himſelf of no reputation,</hi> and <hi>took upon him the forme of a ſervant and was made in the likeneſs of men,</hi> Phil 2. 6, 7. he laid aſide his glory as it were, and ſtooped down infinitely below himſelf into our nature, to do ſervice for us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>he was made under the Law,</hi> (obedient thereto in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling all righteouſneſs,) <hi>to redeem them that were under the Law, that they might receive the adoption of ſons,</hi> Gal. 4. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. he did in our ſtead, and as our ſurety, perfectly ſatisfie the whole Law in all its commands for us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>he did lay down his life for us, he humbled himſelfe,</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:115662:131"/> 
                     <hi>and became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſſe,</hi> Phil. 2. 8. he did ſhed his heart blood to make our peace, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us unto his Father; and have we not then reaſon to truſt him, and to beleeve that he will do us good? Why; ſingle out a perſon who profeſſeth ſincerity unto us, that he would lay out half his eſtate to do us good, we would repoſe ſome confidence on him; but if we knew that he did ſo heartily affect us, that he would die for our good, O ſay we, you may truſt on him, you need not fear to go to him, to requeſt him for this or that courteſie. Now then, Chriſt hath not nakedly <hi>profeſſed,</hi> but hath <hi>really a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ed this;</hi> he entred into bond, as it were, to ſatisfie for us; he did ſhed his very blood, and offered up his very life and ſoul for the beleever, and yet wilt not thou, (for whom he hath done and endured all this) yet wilt thou not truſt in him for merit, for righteouſneſſe, for grace, for ſtrength, &amp;c?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>His diſpoſition.</hi> Though a perſon were very able to do us good, yet if he hated us, we ſhould (I confeſſe) have ſmall encouragement to build our hopes upon him; for two perſons are not to be truſted, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>profeſſed enemy,</hi> and the <hi>falſe friend.</hi> But far be the thought of theſe things in us, touching Jeſus Chriſt; He is graciouſly and lovingly affected towards beleevers. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Walk in love as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us an offering, and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> Epheſ. 3. 19. <hi>To know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulneſſe of God.</hi> Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf doth ſuggeſt unto us this love of Chriſt unto him, as the ſingular ground, why he did by faith live upon him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>The life which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Though I dare not truſt an enemy, yet I dare to truſt my friend; though I will not depend on him for help, yet on my friend I will: Why, a <hi>friend loves at all times,</hi> and love is the principle of bounty and of kindneſſe: He that loves much will do much, beneficence and readineſſe to help, they grow in love as the branches in the root, and therefore Chriſt is ready to help, becauſe exceeding in love to his members. Obſerve the Apoſtle to this very thing in another place. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Let</hi>

                     <hi>us come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtaine mercy, and finde grace to help in time of need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is need in us of <hi>mercy,</hi> (for we ſinne dayly) and need in us <hi>of grace,</hi> (for we are ſtill weak) but in heaven there is a <hi>throne of grace,</hi> there is mercy enough, and grace enough to help.</p>

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> No, be not afraid, but <hi>come boldly unto the throne of grace,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. There is a twofold boldneſſe; There is a <hi>boldneſſe of ignorance,</hi> of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks not: There is a <hi>boldneſſe of holy affiance,</hi> of this he ſpeaks: Thus he comes boldly, who preſents all his needs and requeſts in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and confidently relies upon him for ſupply and acceptance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But, may the ſoul reply, what encouragement have I to raiſe this confident affiance?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> See the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>For we have not an high Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I beſeech you but to remember what your Chriſt is, and then you may boldly come; you are ſenſible; why; he is much more ſenſible of your infirmities, he knows your wants, yea, he feels them; feels them, how? there is a <hi>feeling by way of paſſion</hi> and change, ſo indeed he does not feel them; and there is a <hi>feeling by way of compaſſion,</hi> ſo he feels them (that is) he is tenderly ſenſible of them, he is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionately ready to help them: As a mother, ſhe feels the want of bread, of heat, of cloaths, of liberty, in her child, ſhe is infinitely ready to relieve him; ſuch a kinde of feeling is there in Chriſt to his members in their need; <hi>Ergo,</hi> come boldly to him, crave of him, truſt and rely on him for help.</p>
                  <p>Why elſe is he called a <hi>merciful High Prieſt?</hi> What is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſſe? If you look upon it in man, it is the <hi>ſounding of his bowels,</hi> it is a <hi>compaſſionate ſympathy joyned with a ſingular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to releeve.</hi> And if you look upon it in God or Chriſt, it is a moſt <hi>tender ſenſe of mans infirmities</hi> and <hi>neceſſities,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with an <hi>exceeding propenſion or readineſſe to forgive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſoule,</hi> and to <hi>help</hi> and <hi>ſuccor</hi> and <hi>comfort the Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Thou art truly grieved and humbled for thy ſinnes, and yet dareſt not to live by faith upon Chriſt, that he will get thee the pardon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Why O man; Chriſt is a <hi>merciful high Prieſt,</hi> Here am I ſaith Chriſt, I am very ready to offer up the vertue of my blood for thee.</p>
                  <p>So, thou art much diſtreſſed about the want of grace, and the inſolency of ſin and Satan; why, ſaith Chriſt, loe here I am, I am very willing, very ready to do thee good, to give thee more grace to conquer thy ſins for thee, and Satan for thee, I am a merciful high Prieſt, my bowels are troubled for thee, I love thee earneſtly, I remember thee ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>His conjunction and relation.</hi> I pray you conſider of this, How ſtands it 'twixt Chriſt and a beleever? what union is there? what relation? hath Chriſt no reference unto him? or hath he none unto Chriſt, that he afraid to live upon him? To truſt, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him for his ſupplies,</p>
                  <p>Two things I will briefly touch, 1. The neerneſſe of their relations. Two things I will briefly touch, 2. The ground from them to live by faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>there is a neer relation,</hi> 'twixt Chriſt and a beleever, ſee <hi>Cantiles</hi> 6. 3. <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine.</hi> Why; this is a neer relation indeed, a relation of mutual propriety that Chriſt doth ſay of a Beleever, Thou art mine, and the beleever can reciprocally affirm of Chriſt, thou art mine; As <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid of his wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Thou art bone of my bone, and fleſh of fleſh,</hi> that ſame doth the Apoſtle apply back from the Church to Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 30. we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones. Of all rational relations, none ſo neare, ſo dear, ſo tender as that of a man and his wife, yet in ſuch a relation doth Chriſt and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Again, he is the <hi>head of his body the Church,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 22. the whole Church is his body; every Beleever a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Chriſt the Head. I ſpare the citation of more, as of the <hi>tree</hi> and the <hi>branches,</hi> the <hi>foundation</hi> and the <hi>build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Now this relation is the ground of <hi>affiance,</hi>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:115662:133"/> a direct reaſon why we ſhould live upon Chriſt by faith, For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, doth not <hi>ſpecial relation give ſpecial title:</hi> If a man becomes an husband, hath not the wife hereupon a title to the benefits and comforts of his eſtate? his riches are for her good, and his houſes are for her good, and his land for her good; It holds juſt ſo here; faith eſpouſeth a man to Chriſt, now <hi>Chriſt is mine, and I am his,</hi> and then the Apoſtle infers the title preſently, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>All things are yours.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come, all are yours.</hi> Ver. 23. <hi>For ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, hath not <hi>ſpecial relation a ſpecial obligation?</hi> Why, though a man be not bound but in a bond of charity to relieve and help a woman before he is married; yet when once he is married, then by vertue of that relation, there lies upon him the bond of plaine and particular duty; he is bond <hi>to love his wife as himſelf,</hi> Eph. 5. 28. and to <hi>nouriſh and cheriſh her,</hi> v. 29.

                     </gap>k now how the Apoſtle ſtates our matter, even here too; <hi>(Even as the Lord the Church)</hi> as if Chriſt were the very pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of <hi>this love,</hi> of this <hi>cheriſhing,</hi> and of this <hi>nouriſhing,</hi> of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, hath not <hi>ſpecial relation a ſpecial affection?</hi> I will do much for my ſervant; I will do more for my childe, but I will do moſt of all for my wife: Why? becauſe ſhe is neerer then all, ſhe is my very ſelfe: Chriſt doth much for profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; he leaves not himſelf without ſome teſtimonies of much kindneſſe even to them; What; will he do much for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, much for enemies, and nothing for beleevers, for his own members, for his own ſpouſe? Will he <hi>heal the eare</hi> of one who came to take away his life, and will he not (think you) <hi>heale the heart</hi> of him who hath accepted of him unto life? would he <hi>pray</hi> for them that nailed his hands, and pierced his heart, <hi>(Father forgive them)</hi> and will he not do much more for thee, who grieveſt for thy ſins, prizeſt him in thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, embraceſt him with all thy heart, wouldeſt ſerve him with all thy might? For thee, who art <hi>bone of his bone,</hi> will he not pray <hi>for thee? Father forgive him,</hi> Father <hi>ſupply</hi> him, Father <hi>comfort</hi> him, Father <hi>ſanctifie him,</hi> Father <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> and <hi>preſerve him.</hi>

                  <p>But this I have touched heretofore, therefore I ſpare to inſiſt, propoſing onely one thing; that the <hi>invitation of Chriſt</hi> is not onely to <hi>faith,</hi> but <hi>to the life of faith;</hi> not only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, but to <hi>dependance</hi> alſo: not only to take his <hi>perſon,</hi> but to truſt, and reſt upon <hi>his merit,</hi> and to ſerve our ſelves <hi>of his fulneſſe.</hi> As if Chriſt ſhould ſay unto a beleever, I am thine, and all that I have is thine; now I pray thee in all thy neceſſities, come unto me, live upon my ſtock, draw from my fountaine; when <hi>guilt</hi> is upon thee, make uſe of my <hi>blood;</hi> when wants are upon thee, make uſe of <hi>my treaſure;</hi> when <hi>temptations</hi> are upon thee, make uſe of my <hi>power:</hi> when <hi>infirmities</hi> are upon thee, make uſe of my <hi>interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There be foure things by which we may be perſwaded that Chriſt will do us good, if that we will live upon him by faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>his expreſſe promiſe,</hi> which you ſee in that place alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>John</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Whatſoever ye ask in my Name, that I will do:</hi> Obſerve it well, he ſaith not, ask one particular onely, but <hi>whatſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea and Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>His actual impetration</hi> of all that good which now we do enjoy. Why O Chriſtian, art thou afraid to live upon thy Saviour for more good? who was it that procured unto thee that ſame heavenly condition which now thou doeſt enjoy? haſt thou any relation to God as thy God? Chriſt did procure it: Is any one ſinne ſubdued? Chriſt hath done it: Is any one ſinne got off and pardoned? Chriſt did procure it: Is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny melting in thy breaſt, any hatred of corruption, any deſires of grace, any endeavour, any ſtrength? Chriſt wrought them, Thou doeſt ſeek them, but Chriſt did work them.</p>
                  <p>Now this is to be learned, that what ſpecial thing Chriſt hath done, that is a pledge and an aſſurance that Chriſt is willing to do more: Every gracious fruit and work points us to him the fountaine and cauſe upon whom we are to truſt, not only for the entrance, but alſo for the progreſſe and compleatment of our ſpiritual eſtate.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>His perſonal donation:</hi> He hath <hi>given himſelfe</hi> unto thee, and will he not do other things for thee which is greater.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>His offices:</hi> All of them call upon us to live upon Chriſt by faith. To what end was he <hi>Prieſt?</hi> was it to ſatisfie for himſelf? He needed not to ſatisfie for his own ſinnes who was without all ſinne: Nor doth he make his own peace, whom

                  <p>Now ſay, what a blaſphemous abſurdity were it to conceive of Jeſus Chriſt as of an <hi>Idol,</hi> which hath <hi>eyes, but ſees not;</hi> which hath <hi>eares, but heares not;</hi> which hath <hi>hands, but handles not;</hi> which hath <hi>feet, but walks not.</hi> That he ſhould he a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to <hi>offer for ſinne,</hi> and yet we will not truſt upon him for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the leaſt; that he ſhould <hi>live to make interceſſion,</hi> and yet we will not deliver any one requeſt into his hands, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie on him to obtaine us any one good thing which we need or crave: That he is a <hi>King,</hi> able to ſubdue all his enemies; a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and able to teach any mans heart; but we will not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit our ſouls upon him, we will not repoſe the victories of our corruptions upon his mighty arme, nor the reforming and beautifying of our ſpirits upon his ſingular wiſdom and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Why? what didſt thou think or mean, when thou didſt accept of him to be thy Mediator? didſt thou conjecture that if once thou gaveſt thy conſent to take him, that never after thou ſhouldſt need him? or if ſo, wouldeſt never make uſe of him? Well, no more; what the Apoſtle ſaid in another caſe, that I ſay in this, if we will not <hi>live by faith</hi> upon Chriſt, we do what in us lies <hi>make void the Redemption of Chriſt, the interceſſion of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>holineſſe of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of all the <hi>offices of Christ.</hi>

               <p>Divines obſerve a double act of faith.</p>
               <p>One of adherence, by which it cleaves unto Chriſt, and relies upon him alone for righteouſneſſe, pardon of ſin, grace and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Another is of <hi>evidence,</hi> by which it cleares unto the ſoule its intereſt in Chriſt, and his righteouſneſſe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>In the former, the ſoul renounceth all other corner ſtones, all other rocks of ſalvation, and truſts only upon the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, accepts of him as the only Lord, and relies on him as the only Saviour, caſting or rolling its heavenly and eternal ſafeties into his bleſſed armes.</p>
               <p>In the latter, the ſoul feels it ſelf reciprocally embraced by Chriſt; I have <hi>accepted of him to be my Lord,</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>I am thy King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have <hi>relyed on him to be my Saviour,</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>I am thy ſalvation;</hi> For <hi>pardon of ſinnes,</hi> and he ſaith unto me, <hi>Be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to this part of faith do I deſire to mount the ſoul of a true beleever, <hi>viz.</hi> not only to apprehend Chriſt, but to know <hi>himſelf to be apprehended by him;</hi> not only to <hi>beleeve,</hi> but to <hi>know him whom he hath beleeved.</hi> To riſe thus far by <hi>faith</hi> to

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. <hi>WHat the aſſurance of faith is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It is a <hi>victorious concluſion againſt the ſtrength of doubts, whereby the minde of a beleeving perſon is aſcertained and perſwaded, and upon good ground ſettled, concerning his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal intereſt in Chriſt and his benefits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better opening of this deſcription, be pleaſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe ſubſequent propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>aſſurance of faith,</hi> it is the <hi>concluſion of an evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical ſyllogiſme:</hi> The ſyllogiſme is this, <hi>Whoſoever repents and beleeves in Chriſt, Chriſt with his benefits are his,</hi> and he is Chriſts; but <hi>I do truly repent and beleeve in Chriſt,</hi> therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his benefits are mine, and I am his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Syllogiſme there are three propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, a Propoſition of moſt infallible certainty, it being expreſly the voice of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and of it the minde hath no doubt, but fully aſſents unto it as a principle of Divine truth, <hi>viz. That he who repents and beleeves in Chriſt, is his, and he is Chriſts.</hi> And of this the minde of a beleever may be abundantly perſwaded without queſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onings, and doubts, for as much as it is a part of the Word of God, to whoſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute truth it doth plentifully ſubſcribe.</p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:115662:136"/>
                  <p> The ſecond is a propoſition, carrying with it the direct act of faith, in which the beleeving ſoul doth accept of Chriſt, or receive him, and truſt upon him, by vertue of which there ariſeth a moſt real and true union 'twixt Chriſt and the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>The third and the laſt, which is the concluſion or inference drawn from both the former, comprehends in it the <hi>formal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of a beleeving heart,</hi> that therefore Chriſt is mine and I am his.</p>
                  <p>That he who beleeves in Chriſt, hath Chriſt, and ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; this is not yet that <hi>ſubjective aſſurance of juſtifying faith,</hi> for as much as many an hypocrite may beleeve that truth, and yet have no perſonal intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, that I do beleeve in Chriſt, neither is this <hi>eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſſurance,</hi> for as much as to beleeve is one thing, and to be aſſured is another thing; many a good heart may accept of Chriſt upon all his termes, and articles of peace and life, and may caſt and repoſe it ſelf on him as the only rock and hope of the ſoul, and yet it may be ſo farre from aſſurance, (even at that time when it doth ſo earneſtly cleave unto Chriſt) that inſtead of aſſurance, it may be both toſſed and prevailed upon by doubtings, ſuſpitions, and feares, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its particular and perſonal propriety in Chriſt and in his merits.</p>
                  <p>But the laſt of the propoſitions, <hi>I am Christs, and Christ is mine,</hi> this is <hi>formal aſſurance:</hi> for this concludes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the heart, and hath in it particular and perſonal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>victorious concluſion</hi> againſt the <hi>ſtrength of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> you know that in the minde of man, there are three kinds of working about an object comprehending goodneſſe and truth.</p>
                  <p>One they call <hi>peremptory aſſenting,</hi> and <hi>peremptory diſſentings,</hi> in which the minde doth yeild plainly, or elſe refuſeth to ſubſcribe, and grant the matter propoſed to be true and good.</p>
                  <p>Another they call <hi>doubtings,</hi> which are the wavering acts of of the minde, wherein it doth not abſolutely grant or deny, it doth not abſolutely conclude, that ſo it is, nor abſolutely,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115662:137"/> that ſo it is not; yet rather enclines (for want of further evidence in the ſoul) that it is not ſo, then that it is ſo.</p>
                  <p>The third they call evidence or aſſurance, which is ſuch a work of the minde, wherein, againſt all doubtings and ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the minde ſees clearly the thing to be ſo, or not to be ſo: And thus is it here in the aſſurance of faith, it hath ſuch a light, the minde hath that it is able to riſe beyond, and againſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to convince the ſoul againſt all ſuſpitions, that Chriſt indeed is mine, and I am his.</p>
                  <p>Where, by the way obſerve thus much; that aſſurance doth preſuppoſe ſome doubtings, for if the mind of a believer had not doubtings about its perſonall intereſt, it could not well be ſaid to be now aſſured. Doubtings did verily, and do, and may work in a believing ſoul; yea, but am I ſure that Chriſt is mine, is it certain that my ſins are pardoned? I truſt they are, but I fear they are not.</p>
                  <p>Now aſſurance comes and conquers theſe workings, and clears all the doubting arguments, and convinceth the minde, that of a truth Chriſt is mine, and my ſins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>There are two degrees of doubtings.</p>
                  <p>One conſiſts in the <hi>queſtioning of our beleeving proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> is Chriſt mine, is his righteouſneſſe mine, &amp;c?</p>
                  <p>Another exceeds this, and conſiſts in <hi>dominion,</hi> when the ſoul is ſuppreſt by the ſtrength of theſe doubtings, to ſide with it, and ſtill to hang in ſuſpenſe.</p>
                  <p>Now this latter degree (eſpecially) is aſſurance oppoſite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; namely, it conquers our doubtings, anſwers our arguments, cleares it unto the ſoul againſt the many ſuſpitions which did ariſe, that Chriſt doth indeed owne it, that he is the Saviour thereof, and therefore I call it a victorious conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Aſſurance of faith,</hi> it is an <hi>aſcertaining or perſwading act,</hi> and that is proper and inſeparable from aſſurance; therefore is it ſo expreſſed in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38. <hi>I am perſwaded that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor things to come, ver.</hi> 39. <hi>Nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which</hi>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:115662:137"/> 
                     <hi>is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> Yea, and it is expreſſed by a word of <hi>perſonal certainty,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed:</hi> In knowledge there is alwayes a certainty, for that is one of the maine differences 'twixt it and opinion, that the one leaves the minde uncertain and wavering, and the other determinates the minde with certainty, and infallibility.</p>
                  <p>Whiles the minde remaines like a paire of indifferent ſcales, which bend this way and that way; or like a boat in the river, now floating up, and then ſinking down; now reeling to this ſide, by and by to that ſide; it cannot be ſaid to be aſſured, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Chriſt is mine, perhaps I am his; this is a plaine uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the minde is not perſwaded. But in the aſſurance of faith, the minde is like a ſcale that weighs down, it is perſwaded, and aſcertained, there is a prevalent evidence of the thing. Not only <hi>in abſolute tearmes,</hi> that Chriſt belongs to a believer, but in <hi>reflexive tearmes,</hi> that Chriſt belongs to me, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for me, and he is my redeemer, and this particular, or perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perſwaſion is aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Aſſurance is not all kinds of perſwaſion</hi> or aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, there are two kindes of aſſurance or perſwaſion of the minde touching a mans perſonall intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>One is <hi>Imaginary</hi> and <hi>deluding:</hi> for as the heart of a man may deceive it ſelf about the habit of faith (or any other grace) ſo it may delude him about the acts, and degrees of the ſame: doth the true believer believe in Chriſt? ſo thinks the Hypocrite, that he doth too: Hath the true believer a perſwaſion of his perſonall propriety in Chriſt, which cleares the minde of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? ſo hath the Hypocrite too, a moſt exalted confidence an iron faith that would never bend, nor bow by doubtings. It may be with him as with a poore man in a dreame; what the rich man hath by propriety, and in poſſeſſion, even that ſame thing may the pooreſt man have in a dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fancy, and imagination.</p>
                  <p>But then ask the Hypocrite; by what grounds art thou thus confidently perſwaded; what did encline thy mind hereto, what promiſe haſt thou found that Chriſt is, and will be his, whoſe heart was never humbled for ſin, whoſe heart ſtill retains the love of ſin? Now, as the man who being demanded
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115662:138"/> how <hi>he came without his wedding garment, he is ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fool</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> Prov. 14. 16.) <hi>rageth and is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> and ſo the preſumptuous perſon, He ſinneth, and yet is perſwaded he walketh in his ſinnes, and yet is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>I pray you remember that the aſſurance of faith is no ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and boyſtrous ſetling of the minde, that Chriſt is mine however, though I be never ſo ignorant and wicked, and though I live never ſo wretchedly and profanely; yet Chriſt is mine, and God is my mercifull Father, and my ſinnes are pardoned: O no, this is a <hi>Diabolical</hi> aſſurance, it is no <hi>Evangelical</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>Another is <hi>grounded, and divinely rational,</hi> and it alwayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes ſound repentance and faith: That aſſurance which goes before theſe, is falſe; abſolutely I am bound to repent and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but I cannot be aſſured, but in a conditionall order: If I ſhould be aſſured that Chriſt were mine before, before I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, this were a lie: foraſmuch as Chriſt is not mine, untill I do by faith accept of him, and if I ſhould be aſſured that my ſins were pardoned before I did repent, I did in this delude mine own heart, foraſmuch as ſin is not pardoned, unleſſe it be repented of. No, but I muſt repent of my ſins, I muſt accept of Jeſus Chriſt offered unto me in the Goſpel, to be my Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and now I labour to be aſſured, now I come to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, having ſubſcribed to all the propoſitions, and articles of the Goſpel, that now Chriſt is mine, and I do by the Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince my ſoul that ſo it muſt be. For thus I argue with my ſoul, whoſoever repents, and believes, and endeavors to walk in Chriſt, aſſuredly Chriſt is his, and he is Chriſts; but I do this, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt is mine.</p>
                  <p>I cannot make ſo ſhort a cut as the preſumptuous perſon doth, Chriſt died for ſinners, therefore for me; God is merciful, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my ſins are pardoned without any more ado. O no, there is an orderly progreſſe in true aſſurance. It doth not <hi>(ſaltum facere)</hi> ſtride over to extreames; As if a man ſhould ſee a Leaſe drawn, and preſently concludes the houſes are mine, the lands are mine; No, but he muſt hear, and underſtand, and weigh things, and ſubſcribe, and ſeal to the conditions, and then he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115662:138"/> may ſafely and boldly ſay that they are his. So muſt the ſoul <hi>hearken to the tenor of the Goſpel,</hi> underſtand both the precious offer, and the peculiar conditions of Chriſt; then he muſt conſent unto them, and accept of Chriſt to be Lord and Saviour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to forſake every ſin, and to yield up his heart and life to the obedience of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and earneſtly <hi>ſeek the Lord</hi> by his <hi>Spirit, to perſwade him of his particular intereſt in Chriſt, and look up ſtedfaſtly, and waite upon the Lord in the uſe of the ordinances,</hi> and other conſecrated meanes; Thus is the aſſurance of faith wrought in the ſoul, and upon theſe grounds doth it ſettle the mind.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>Aſſurance of faith</hi> (concerning which we ſpeake) directs man, even to a <hi>perſonal evidence of his particular intereſts in Chriſt and his benefits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is you know a double evidence.</p>
                  <p>One is <hi>real,</hi> and reſpects the thing, or object to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;</p>
                  <p>Another is <hi>perſonal,</hi> and reſpects the ſtate of him who doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;</p>
                  <p>Now aſſurance of faith, conſiſts in the determining of the minde, about the particular goodneſſe of that thing, which it aſſents unto in the general as moſt true, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt is my Lord, and my God, that he is ſalvation for me; it opens the eyes as it were to ſee, what Chriſt is to me, and what he hath done for me, and what he will do to me.</p>
                  <p>And thus briefly have you had a ſhort expl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The Papiſts will not hear of it by any meanes, (ſome of them) unleſſe in an extraordinary way: They conceive that faith is notable to raiſe the minde beyond a moral hope, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115662:139"/> conjecture, and many lewd and lazy Proteſtants ſhake hands with them in that opinion. But I will cleare it unto you, <hi>that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very believer may come to this aſſurance:</hi> It is a poſſible thing, I dare not ſay that every believer <hi>de facto</hi> is aſſured, yet he may be aſſured of his particular intereſt, and this I will evidence ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The believing ſoul is not uncapable of perſwaſion:</hi> They ſay that faith doth not deſtroy, but elevate the underſtanding; and that ſame is a truth, for it doth new temper the underſtanding, and the will, but not overthrow their ſubſtantial natures and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. Now this is undeniable, that the power of reflexion is natural to the underſtanding: It is ſuch a faculty which is able to look upon its own actings, and its own ſtate; yea, and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion by way of certainty,</hi> the underſtanding is capable of it; foraſmuch as it is by knowledge, and ſenſe, and experience made moſt aſſuredly certain, about many objects and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe faith doth not deſtory, but elevate the minde, it may by faith come to a perſwaſion and reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againe, to urge things (as yet) in a rational way; <hi>Faith can ſee as ſtrong reaſon, and argument to perſwade and ſettle the minde, and aſſure it, as the Phyloſopher</hi> can to raiſe the minde to a certainty of his concluſions; The mindes perſwaſion depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally upon ſtrong evidence and the power of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</p>
                  <p>Now faith can bring as ſtrong arguments to convince and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the minde: for its arguments depend upon two ſtrong teſtimonies, One of the <hi>infallible Word of God,</hi> the other on the <hi>voice of a renewed conſcience; Ergo,</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. God would not <hi>promiſe that to a believer in this life, which is impoſſible for the believer to riſe unto:</hi> Foraſmuch as promiſes are of things as future, they are the undertaking of good things, which ſhall come to paſſe, and be performed, now every future thing is a poſſible thing, that which ſhall be, we may co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I will premiſe onely a thing or two.</p>
                  <p>One is, that <hi>ſome duties concerne all men at all times,</hi> and <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi> as to repent and to beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Other duties concern ſome men, and thoſe in an <hi>order</hi> and <hi>mediately:</hi> As to be aſſured of a mans particular intereſt in Chriſt, it is not an immediate duty, it doth not concern a man meerly, as an abſolute ſinner: for a man who is unconverted and yet unbeleeving is not bound to be perſwaded that he is Chriſts, and Chriſt is his, unleſſe we will ſay, that he is bound to be perſwaded of a lie; no, but he muſt firſt be a beleever, he muſt accept of Jeſus Chriſt upon his own termes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a beleever, I ſay, he is bound to labour for particular aſſurance: Not to let the real intereſt of Chriſt in him, and of his ſoul in Chriſt, to hang hovering and in diſpute, but to determine them by particular and perſonal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>Againe, premiſe this, it is one thing to ſpeed <hi>de facto</hi> what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very beleever hath, and it is another thing to ſpeak <hi>de jure,</hi> what every beleever ſhould have: It is true, that every one
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115662:140"/> who hath Chriſt, cannot be yet aſſured, and ſay, that Chriſt is mine, but then, as Chriſt is really his (as certainly he is thine, as thy husband is thy husband) ſo the Chriſtian is obliged to aſſure his heart thereof.</p>
                  <p>Which I ſhall eaſily clear by Argument.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We are bound to <hi>draw neer unto God in the full aſſurance of faith,</hi> Heb. 10. 22. Which is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> conceive, in a cleare perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that we ſhall not faile, but enjoy the good which he promiſeth; now this cannot be, unleſſe a man be aſſured and perſwaded that God is his God, and Chriſt is his Chriſt: for as much as <hi>perſwaſion of audience</hi> doth always ariſe from a preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſion of perſonal and mutual intereſt;</hi> I cannot by faith be perſwaded that God wil give ſuch a good thing, or ſuch, unleſs I am firſt perſwaded, that he is my God, that God is my God, or Chriſt is my Chriſt; It is a fundamental perſwaſion, upon which all others are built; for this gives life and ſettlement to my doubting ſoul; I many times doubt, but ſhall I have this thing which I ask? yes, ſayes the beleeving heart? but how are you aſſured of it? I reply, becauſe God is my God, he hath given himſelf unto me, <hi>Ergo</hi> he will give this, but how know you that God is your God? Upon good ground; why; ſaith the beleeving ſoul, of that I am abundantly perſwaded, I doubt it not, hereupon the ſoul raiſeth it ſelf to that other aſſurance, of <hi>acceptance and audience,</hi> why; then I will nor doubt of this, I will be confident that then the Lord will heare, for he is my God; and <hi>David</hi> goes this way very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are bound (all our dayes) <hi>to give God thanks for his greateſt mercies,</hi> now I think that the beſtowing of Chriſt upon the ſoule is as great a mercy as ever poore ſinners had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> It is ſo, but what of this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> But we cannot give God hearty thanks whiles we are doubtful of our particular intereſt in Chriſt: Can'ſt thou go unto the Lord, and ſay? O Lord, I bleſſe thee from my ſoul for all the mercies which thou haſt conferred on me; health I have, and I know it, for which I do thank thee; riches I have, and friends, and this I know too, and for them I thank
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115662:140"/> thee too; I thank thee alſo exceedingly from the bottome of my ſoul, for that thou haſt given thy own Sonne to me, Jeſus Chriſt, but truly, I know not whether thou haſt given him to me, or no: I thank thee exceedingly for the pardon of my vile ſinnes in this blood, but verily I am not ſure of this, I rather think they are not pardoned. Nay, this will not runne ſmooth, and the reaſon is, becauſe ſo much particular evidence as God gives a man of his perſonal intereſt in himſelf, or Chriſt, or his merits, ſo much (and no greater) thankfulneſſe will the ſoul be brought unto.</p>

                     </gap>eſſe, that is, thou hadſt no portion in Chriſt; why; what avails all this as long as thou art Chriſtleſs? as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>ſeeing I am childleſſe?</hi> In whom is God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto thee, but in Chriſt? and how wilt thou ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, if thou have not Chriſt? by whom canſt thou get ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by Chriſt? and why then wilt not thou force thy ſoul to give all diligence to make thy part in Chriſt ſure to thy ſoul, that

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, what doeſt thou think of the <hi>pardon of ſinnes?</hi> verily the time was once, even then when thy ſpirit did roare all the night, and thou foundeſt no quiet in the day, when thy moyſture was turned into the drought of Summer, and thy ſoul was diſquieted within thee; I ſay in that time thou couldeſt with many teares break out, and ſay, with <hi>David, Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe ſinne is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal 32. 1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> O what wouldeſt thou have given to have beleeved, that thy ſinnes ſhould be pardoned? thou couldeſt then diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver death in ſo unpardoned a ſtate and life, then in a diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and abſolved condition. Why I pray you, is pardon of ſinne ſo precious a thing? and is the aſſured knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a ſmall thing? Is it not enough to have the pardon paſſe, not onely the ſeale of the King, but the eye alſo of the malefactor?</p>
                  <p>Yea, yet further, what think you of eternal life? what is it? O, I cannot reach it by thoughts, much leſſe by words; <hi>Life!</hi> no ſuch thing on the earth as it; <hi>eternal life,</hi> what thing in heaven more then it? To ſee my God, my Chriſt, to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly united to them, to be filled with the perfections of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, brightneſſe of glory, to <hi>know him as we are known,</hi> to love him in the tranſcendency of love; I know not what I ſay; for I ſpeak of eternal life: O! if the the glimpſe of divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour here be the admiration of our ſoules, the perfection of our joyes, the heaven on earth! tell me, what is the fulneſſe of his favour? what is the full evidence of his favour? what is the everlaſting evidence of his favour? Now, eternal life is all this, all this; alas I have ſaid nothing of it yet; <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man what God hath, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And is not this a matter to be determined and aſcertained to our ſouls? what, to let eternal life hang in ſuſpenſe; verily, though until we do mount and riſe to the aſſurance of faith, we leave (for our part, though the thing may be ſure in it ſelfe)
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115662:141"/> even this alſo, our eternal life as a thing doubtful. Thou wile not hold the leaſt quillet of thy land, upon unevident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure term, yet wilt thou? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Aſſurance will marvellouſly ſettle and quiet the ſoul. David</hi> expreſſeth ſo much, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Lord, life thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. Ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Thou hast put gladneſſe in my heart, more then in the time that their corn and wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>I will lay me down and ſleep.</hi> The ſhip at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor is ſafe, but in a calme it is quiet; faith makes our ſtate <hi>ſure,</hi> and aſſurance <hi>peaceful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two effects he there delivers of this bleſſed aſſurance; one is a <hi>tranſcendent joy,</hi> and another is a compleat <hi>peace:</hi> It glads the heart, and it pacifies the heart: It is moſt true, that faith in its <hi>vital act</hi> (of <hi>acceptation)</hi> intitles us to both. Every beleever hath cauſe of great joy, &amp; ſweet peace; but it is faith in this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>act</hi> (of <hi>aſſurance)</hi> which repleniſheth the ſoul with actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al joy, and actual comfort; For now the beleever ſees and knows his happineſſe; He hath a Chriſt and knows it; he hath pardon of ſinne, and knows it; he ſtands in favour of God, and knows it: that which held up his ſoule, is now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all the cauſes of his comfort ſhine, as it were, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover themſelves in a way of well grounded propriety. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid concerning his enemies, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 27. 1. <hi>The Lord is my light, and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear? The Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom ſhall I be afraid?</hi> So the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured ſoule in this caſe can exult, God is my God, Chriſt is my Chriſt, they have pardoned my ſinnes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of my perſon, what ſhould trouble me? what ſhould diſquiet me? my ſoule doth now <hi>rejoyce in God my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Who ſhall lay any thing to the the charge of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? it is God that justifieth; who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died,</hi> Romans 8. 34. Sinne, that is pardoned; Juſtice, that is ſatisfied; my ſoul, that is reconciled; my perſon, that is juſtified; my prayers, they are anſwered; my heart, that is pacified, for God is mine, and Chriſt is mine, and I am his. Before I am aſſured, I ſee my ſinnes, look up to Chriſt, and adventure my ſoule on him for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I truſt on him, yet I may feare; but when I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115662:142"/> I ſee my ſinnes look up to Chriſt, and my ſoule is quiet and rejoyceth. As it was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they were <hi>Neere the red ſea,</hi> they looked back on their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and looked up to God, but yet they were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly afraid:</hi> Afterwards, when they had <hi>paſt through the read ſea,</hi> and <hi>ſtood upon the ſhore,</hi> they looked back upon the ſame enemies, but now as <hi>drowned,</hi> and then their <hi>ſighes</hi> were turned into <hi>joyes,</hi> and their feares into peace: <hi>They exceedingly rejoyed.</hi> Why; in aſſurance, though we look upon the ſame ſinnes, yet not in the ſame manner: Now we look upon them as <hi>drowned enemies;</hi> as iniquities <hi>caſt into the depths of the ſea,</hi> as pardoned iniquities: Now, though ſin doth grieve the ſoule, yet ſinne pardoned doth quiet and rejoyce the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Aſſurance doth arme the heart againſt future tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of temptations, againſt both which the aſſurance of faith doth arme the beleever.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>To ſinne:</hi> Though aſſurance be a kinde of heaven upon earth, yet in this doth the <hi>beatifical viſion</hi> differ from a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving aſſurance,</hi> that the one leaves no ſinne at all, but the other is a day of great comfort to a beleeving ſinner; yet even an aſſured perſon hath yet much of a ſinning nature remaining in him.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe, though aſſurance doth not wholly <hi>caſt off feare,</hi> yet it doth exceedingly <hi>keep off ſinne:</hi> A beleeving perſon ſhall not eaſily ſinne whiles he is reading his pardon, and looking his Chriſt in the face. <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſſe and ſinne againſt God?</hi> If the meere <hi>reſpect of a God</hi> was ſo prevalent with <hi>Joſeph;</hi> O how much more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful is the <hi>propriety in a God?</hi> How can I do this great wickedneſſe and ſinne againſt <hi>my God? Should ſuch a man as I flee,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nehemiah!</hi> ſo the aſſured Chriſtian, ſhould ſuch a man as I ſinne!</p>
                  <p>Nay, remember it: Sinne is never more odious to the heart, then when the heart is moſt aſſured: The great and rich mercy of God in Chriſt, it is the principal bane of a temptation: The man who formerly would have ſtept out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115662:142"/> the threats of juſtice, having now obtained mercy, trembles at the very thoughts of ſinning.</p>

                  <p>Why is duty to good hearts ſometimes ſo weary-ſome, ſo ſlack, ſo troubleſome? verily, faith is weak, doubts are ſtrong, feares are many; could they once ſee God to be their God, Chriſt to be their Lord and Saviour; ſinnes pardoned in his blood, and all this to them. Now even the lame would walk, and the weary would runne, the heart would ſet upon obedience with all its ſtrength, and all its care.</p>

                  <p>What a thing is this! that God ſhould give his Covenant to me, his Sonne to me, his Mercies to me, his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to me, his glory in heaven unto me! I love a man who defends my Name, I love a man who gives me a book, I love a man who gives me my ranſom, I loue a man who gives me a meales meat; Ah! poore things in compariſon: how do I then infinitely exceed in love to my God, who I know hath pardoned, hath juſtified, hath accepted, will ſave me for ever?</p>
                  <p>More might be ſaid of all particular graces whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Aſſurance by faith doth but eaſe us of the world, and mounts the ſoul above it.</hi>
